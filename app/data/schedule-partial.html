          <p style="line-height: 18px;">Since Iijima’s finding in 1991, the carbon nanotube has become one of the most popular and exciting research fields. A variety of applications of carbon nanotubes have been expected and demonstrated based on their unique properties. Many growth methods for carbon nanotubes have been developed, among which catalytic chemical vapor deposition has become a dominating production technique. However, the as-grown pristine product is usually a mixture of tangled carbon nanotubes with diverse microstructures, which become a big hurdle for their applications. In spite of many post-growth purification, cutting, sorting, and assembling technologies being developed, in-situ direct growth of desired carbon nanotube structures is always highly preferred from the beginning. This presentation reviews the longtime efforts and advances in controlled growth of carbon nanotubes with specific chirality and aligned structures, such as vertically aligned carbon nanotube arrays on substrates, free-standing horizontally aligned carbon nanotube films, horizontally aligned semiconducting carbon nanotubes on substrates, etc. Some interesting applications based on such carbon nanotube structures are also presented.</p>

          <p style="line-height: 18px;">Graphene is a single-atom-thick sheet of hexagonally arranged, sp2-bonded carbon atoms that is not an integral part of a carbon material but is freely suspended or adhered on a foreign substrate, and has excellent properties, such as high mechanical strength and modulus, high thermal and electrical conductivities, very stable thermal and chemical stabilities, and unique electronic properties. Graphene materials, overarching terms for the collection of two-dimensional materials that contain the word “graphene”, including multilayered materials (N less than about 10), chemically modified forms (graphene oxide, reduced graphene oxide), and materials made from graphene precursors, are expected for various applications.<br /><br />Synthesis of graphene materials in a large quantity at reasonable cost is very important. Basically, graphene can be synthesized by mechanical exfoliation, epitaxial growth, chemical exfoliation, CVD and chemical synthesis from small molecules. Among them, chemical exfoliation of graphite and CVD on different substrates are the most-widely-used two methods.<br /><br />Due to their unique and outstanding properties, graphene materials may have wide applications in many fields, from electronics to new energy field, and from transportation to space as low-weight structural materials, including composites, anti-corrosion coatings, conductive inks, energy storage devices, electronics, optoelectronics, photonics, sensors and bio-sensors, bio-medical materials and devices, thermal management materials, etc. However, great efforts are highly needed for the research and development, and commercialization and market explorations of graphene materials.</p>

          <p style="line-height: 18px;">Single walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) have been served as an ideal material platform to study electronic transport phenomena in 1-dimensional (1D) materials platform nearly 25 years. In this presentation, we first summarize the status of our current understanding electronic transport in SWNTs. Coulomb drag effect is a mesoscopic effect which manifests many body interactions between two low-dimensional systems, which has served an extremely useful probe the strong correlation in quantum systems. When two electrically isolated conductors are brought close, a current in one conductor can generate friction and drag electrons in the other via Coulomb interaction, thereby causing a charge imbalance in the dragged layer. We discuss Coulomb drag between a two-dimensional (2D) electron gas in graphene and a 1D wire composed of a carbon nanotube. We find that drag occurs when the bulk of graphene is conducting but is strongly suppressed in the quantum Hall regime when magnetic field confines conducting electrons to the edges of graphene and far from the nanotube. We also demonstrate that local gating from the nanotube leads to quantum interference between counter-propagating edge states inducing periodic modulation of the drag resistance with magnetic field. Out of equilibrium and non- linear drag measurements show intriguing inter- play between 1D to 2D conductors, leading to the novel hybrid electronic device applications. In the hydrodynamic regime, where the electron-electron scattering length is smaller than the mean free path and device size, the collective behavior of the electrons in graphene is predicted to resemble a viscous fluid. Coulomb drag, an inter-layer interaction in which current in one layer induces a current in a proximate conducting layer, has been shown to occur between carbon nanotubes and graphene separated by a few-layer boron nitride flake. This allows us to use a carbon nanotube as a controllable 1D perturbation to create the shearing drag forces in the graphene that result in the trademark viscous behaviors of the hydrodynamic regime. By examining the spatial dependence of the drag signal, we can deduce the pattern of the hydrodynamic flow in graphene at different doping levels.</p>

          <p style="line-height: 18px;">Semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes (s-SWCNTs) are attractive as components in energy harvesting applications because of their strong and energetically tunable optical absorption, and high charge carrier mobilities due to the delocalized nature of the π-electron system. Inherent in energy harvesting systems are the needs to balance multiple competing processes: (1) absorb energy over appropriate regions of the electromagnetic spectrum (visible, infrared, UV) to generate energetic species (excitons, charges, phonons) within the active layer; (2) transport, transfer, or interconvert the excitations in a controlled manner using interfaces; and (3) collect the appropriate energetic species efficiently to produce useful work. SWCNTs are unique nanomaterials within energy harvesting schemes, in that they naturally provide a high degree of interfacial surface area (both external and endohedral) for creating energetically tuned interfaces that can direct energy and charge carriers in specific ways. This presentation will highlight the critical roles played by interfaces between small molecules and s-SWCNTs in a variety of model energy harvesting systems. Small molecule dyes encapsulated within s-SWCNTs can be used to sensitize the surrounding SWCNTs to visible light <i>via</i> ultrafast excitation energy transfer.<sup>1</sup> Interfaces between s-SWCNTs and small molecule electron acceptors can be used to efficiently dissociate photo-generated excitons <i>via</i> photo-induced charge transfer, producing the long-lived separated charges needed for efficient solar energy harvesting.<sup>2</sup> Ground-state charge transfer between s-SWCNT and small molecules with appropriate energetics can be used to sensitively tune the majority carrier density (both for holes and electrons) within s-SWCNTs, facilitating efficient thermal energy harvesting.<sup>3</sup> Within each of these systems, I will highlight our efforts aimed at understanding the detailed connection between the thermodynamics, kinetics, and molecular structure at play at the molecule/s-SWCNT interface. Such fundamental understanding of these model interfaces can inform the design of more efficient energy harvesting systems other opto-electronic devices.<br /><br />1.

          <p style="line-height: 18px;">Carbon nanotubes hold great potential but also face significant challenges for various electronic application. Regarding nano- and RF electronics, obtaining high-density horizontally aligned carbon nanotubes with high semiconducting purity (&gt;99.99%) has been an important but challenging goal. Here we report record radio frequency (RF) performance of carbon nanotube transistors based on combined use of a self-aligned T-shape gate structure, and well-aligned, high semiconducting purity, high-density polyﬂuorene-sorted semiconducting carbon nanotubes, which were deposited using dose-controlled, ﬂoating evaporative self-assembly method. These transistors show outstanding direct current (DC) performance with on-current density of 350 μA/μm, transconductance as high as 310 μS/μm, and superior current saturation with normalized output resistance greater than 100 kΩ·μm. These transistors create a record as carbon nanotube RF transistors that demonstrate both the current-gain cutoﬀ frequency (ft) and the maximum oscillation frequency (fmax) greater than 70 GHz. Furthermore, these transistors exhibit good linearity performance with 1 dB gain compression point (P1dB) of 14 dBm and input third-order intercept point (IIP3) of 22 dBm. In addition, I will present aligned carbon nanotube (CNT) synaptic transistors for large-scale neuromorphic computing systems. The synaptic behavior of these devices is achieved via charge-trapping effects, commonly observed in carbon-based nanoelectronics. In this work, charge trapping in the high-k dielectric layer of top-gated CNT field-effect transistors (FETs) enables the gradual analog programmability of the CNT channel conductance with a large dynamic range (i.e., large on/off ratio). Here, we demonstrate exceptional uniformity of aligned CNT FET synaptic behavior, as well as significant robustness and nonvolatility via pulsed experiments, establishing their suitability for neural network implementations. Additionally, this technology is based on a wafer-level technique for constructing highly aligned arrays of CNTs with high semiconducting purity and is fully CMOS compatible, ensuring the practicality of large-scale CNT+CMOS neuromorphic systems. We also demonstrate fine-tunability of the aligned CNT synaptic behavior and discuss its application to adaptive online learning schemes and to homeostatic regulation of artificial neuron firing rates. We simulate the implementation of unsupervised learning for pattern recognition using a spike-timing-dependent-plasticity scheme, indicate system-level performance (as indicated by the recognition accuracy), and demonstrate improvements in the learning rate resulting from tuning the synaptic characteristics of aligned CNT devices.<br /><br /></p>

          <p style="line-height: 18px;">Suspended single wall carbon nanotubes are at cryogenic temperatures both extraordinary nano-electromechanical systems and prototypical clean and defect-free single electron devices. The interaction of the corresponding two fields of physics allows for many interesting studies. In particular, by measuring the gate voltage dependence of the transversal vibration frequency, the evolution of the charge on a quantum dot embedded in the nanotube can be evaluated at high precision. We apply this technique to the limit of strong Kondo correlations between a nanotube quantum dot and its contacts [1]. The current through the nanotube displays a clear odd-even pattern (i.e., a &quot;Kondo ridge&quot; at odd electron number) as a function of gate voltage. The time-averaged charge on the quantum dot, however, shows no such odd-even pattern, and can be well modeled via sequential tunneling only. We conclude that the Kondo current is carried via virtual occupation of the quantum dot alone. This is in excellent agreement with recently published results coupling a nanotube to a coplanar waveguide resonator [2], where the transmitted radio-frequency phase depends on the compressibility of the electronic system.<br /><br />[1] K.

          <p style="line-height: 18px;">Additive manufacturing, in which three-dimensional (3D) functional architectures are rapidly prototyped via printing, has in recently years emerged as the promising approach to increase product sophistication while reduce material waste and energy consumption. The development for additive manufacturing of future electronic devices hinges on the availability of 3D printable functional materials. We report a versatile strategy to obtain stable gel with nanowires for 3D printing of electronic devices. Inorganic metallic and non-metallic nanowires, widely studied one-dimensional (1D) functional nanomaterials that are generally difficult to disperse in solvents for printing, can be effectively cross-linked, or hinged, by a small amount of graphene oxide nanosheets. The resulting 3D network forms a dynamically stable suspension in water, in a similar fashion as hydrogels in which 1D polymer chains are cross-linked via hydrogen bonding. Functional gels of silver nanowires, zinc oxide nanowires, and manganese oxide nanowires have all been prepared and printed into various 3D and self-supported architectures via extrusion-based 3D-printing. The electrical conductivity of the 3D-printed silver nanowire conductor can reach over 40,000 S/cm right after solidifying at ambient condition. The feasibility of these nanowire gels is demonstrated by fabricating wearable electronics of thin-film field transistor, UV-detector and micro-supercapacitor with promising performance via extrusion-based 3D-printing.</p>

          <p style="line-height: 18px;">The two-dimensional (2D) material family covers diverse and distinct but complementary optoelectronic properties. When considering large-scale manufacturability of electronic, optoelectronic and photonic devices of these 2D materials, their solution processability offers a cost effective and realistic option. Functional ink formulation and well-controlled printing of these materials to ensure high device-to-device repeatability is central to this argument.<br /><br />For ink formulation of these 2D materials, which can be best described as &quot;powders&quot;, solvents and ink rheological properties play a critical role in printing and device fabrication as well as the ultimate device performance [1,2]. Starting with inkjet printing, I will discuss key ink formulation strategies of these novel 2D materials and printed devices. I will show that the choice of unique solvent blends allows us to engineer counteracting Marangoni flows in drying droplets. This enables uniform, reliable inkjet printing towards scalable development of printed electronic, photonic and optoelectronic devices of a range of 2D materials [2,3]. In the latter half of my talk, I will move into printing on conformable substrates as well large format print technologies and show that a combination of advanced materials printed by traditional graphics printing and contemporary electronics could promote simple, yet powerful and inexpensive technologies.<br /><br />[1] L.

          <p style="line-height: 18px;">Two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are composed of stacks of atomically thin layers, that can be exfoliated until a single layer. This lead to the discovery of interesting properties related to their electronic and phonons structure. Resonant Raman scattering is a very strong technique to investigate their excitons, phonons and exciton-phonon coupling. Recently, Carvalho et al [1] reported a double resonance Raman study for monolayer and bulk MoS<sub>2</sub>, in which the assignment of second-order peaks was proposed considering combinations of Transversal acoustic and Longitudinal acoustic phonons (TA and LA respectively) at M and K points participate of the process. That experiment was done by varying the incident photon energy, almost continuously, across the excitonic levels. However, photoluminescence measurements reveal a dependence of the excitonic levels energy with the sample temperature. In this work, we study the dependency of monolayer MoS<sub>2</sub> Raman spectra with temperature and excitation energy. In special, we are interested in the physics of the double resonance peaks and the way it changes with the in-situ variation of the sample temperature. The dependence of the excitonic levels with the temperature is responsible for a selection of phonon wavevectors during the double-resonance process. The experiments were performed on bulk and monolayered samples with in-situ temperature variation from 80 to 700K for different laser excitation energies. A temperature resonance behaviour for the double-resonant Raman peaks was observed and explained considering both temperature dependence of the phonon wavenumber and the exciton energy.

          <p style="line-height: 18px;">Transport in systems with many particles experiencing frequent mutual collisions (such as gases or liquids) has been studied for more than two centuries and is accurately described by the theory of hydrodynamics. It has been argued theoretically for a long time that the collective behaviour of charge carriers in solids can also be treated by the hydrodynamic approach. However, despite many attempts, very little evidence of hydrodynamic electron transport has been found so far. Graphene encapsulated between hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) offers an ideal platform to study electron hydrodynamics as it hosts an ultra-clean electronic system with the electron-electron mean free path being the shortest lengths scale in the problem. In this presentation, we will discuss why electron hydrodynamics has not been observed before and how it manifests itself in electron transport. In particular, it will be shown that electrons in graphene can behave as a very viscous fluid (more viscous than honey) forming vortices of applied electron current [1], as it is shown in the figure. We will discuss the approaches which can be used to measure the viscosity of electron liquid [2] and its behaviour in presence of magnetic field. Last but not least, we will discuss how electron hydrodynamics can be used for the development of resonant terahertz photodetectors.<br /><br />1. Bandurin, D. A. et al.

          <p style="line-height: 18px;">Graphene materials (GMs), such as graphene, graphene oxide (GO), reduced GO (rGO), and graphene quantum dots (GQDs), are rapidly emerging as a new class of broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents. Here we describe their state-of-the-art and potential future covering both fundamental aspects and biomedical applications. First, the current understanding of the antimicrobial mechanisms of GMs is illustrated, and the complex picture of underlying structure–property–activity relationships is sketched. Next, the different modes of utilization of antimicrobial GMs are explained, which include their use as colloidal dispersions, surface coatings, and photothermal/photodynamic therapy agents. Due to their practical relevance, the examples where GMs function as synergistic agents or release platforms for metal ions and/or antibiotic drugs are also discussed. Later, the applicability of GMs in the design of wound dressings, infection-protective coatings, and antibioticlike formulations (&quot;nanoantibiotics&quot;) is assessed. Notably, to support our assessments, the existing clinical applications of conventional carbon materials are also evaluated. Finally, the key hurdles of the field are highlighted, and several possible directions for future investigations are proposed. We hope that the roadmap provided here will encourage researchers to tackle remaining challenges toward clinical translation of promising research findings and help realize the potential of GMs in antimicrobial nanomedicine.</p>

          <p style="line-height: 18px;">Statistically, we chew around 800 times in an average meal; that's almost a million times a year. We put our teeth under huge mechanical strain, and often require fillings to repair them. Fillings are typically made of a mixture of metals, such as copper, mercury, silver and tin, or composites of powdered glass and ceramic. Typical metal fillings can corrode and composite fillings (thus far) are not very strong; Graphene on the other hand is 200 times stronger than steel and doesn't corrode, making it a prime new candidate for dental fillings. Graphene can, therefore, be used to make mechanically stronger composite-dental fillings which also do not corrode. Despite some challenges and the fact that carbon nanotubes-polymer composites are sometimes better in some particular performance, graphene-polymer composites may have wide applications in dentistry due to their outstanding properties and the availability of graphene in a large quantity and at low cost. One of the main problems, for patients, associated with dental-polymers is that of location. This stems from the fact they must be situated within the mouth and this proves to be an extremely demanding setting, where exposure to moisture, high temperatures, and abrasion from tooth brushes plus intake of food all have to be dealt with. These conditions can lead to complications such as mechanical failures which negate clinical success and over time mandates remedial work for restoration with associated cost and inconvenience. Graphene has potential applications in dental-polymer materials as it has the required mechanical properties as well as being biocompatible. Here we present new work into the application of graphene for the fabrication of potential dental-polymer materials.</p>

          <p style="line-height: 18px;">Fuel cells, supercapacitors and lithium-sulphur batteries are the typical energy conversion and storage devices of great significance in which carbon-based nanomaterials play irreplaceable role. The functionalized carbon-based nanomaterials could be applied to fuel cells to lower Pt loading by highly dispersing and immobilizing Pt-based nanoparticles, or to totally get rid of Pt with the metal-free electrocatalytic ability themselves. The abundant nanostructures and morphologies, tunable compositions, high surface area, good conductivity, small volume expansion, as well as the low cost and environmental benignity make the carbon-based nanomaterials have great potential as electrode materials of supercapacitors and lithium-sulphur batteries. In this talk I will give a brief introduction about our study on the synthesis, performance and mechanism of carbon-based nanostructures, especially the nanocages, for this kind of energy conversion and storage. Special attention will be paid to the carbon-based nanomaterials doped with electron-rich N, electron-deficient B, and the both, as well as to the dopant-free carbon nanomaterials, to elucidate the correlation of performance with electronic configuration, which is a general interesting issue in developing the advanced carbon-based energy materials [1].<br /><br />[1] Q.

            Carbon Nanotube Dry Adhesives with Performances Superior to Nature-originated Adhesions

          <p style="line-height: 18px;">While chemical bonding are widely utilized in synthetic adhesives, nature-originated adhesions as exemplified by gecko and insects are mediated by van der Waals (vdW) forces, which arise from the attraction between molecules or atomic groups. As seen in geckos' feet, countless micrometre-sized setae with high aspect ratio are densely assembled onto macroscopic pads for intimate contacts with target surfaces, excelling in terms of adhesion strength among natural adhesion systems and allowing their locomotion on almost any vertical surface. Here, we fabricated a series of CNT dry adhesives applied on rough surfaces for instance, polymer, paper, wood and even sand paper and painting wall with the roughness ranged from nanometer to millimeter scale. Roughness has been turned from &quot;enemy&quot; to adhesion &quot;enhancer&quot; that the record-high adhesion strength (135 ± 10.3 N/cm2) was reported on the printing wall [1]. From our extensive investigation, we have elucidated the general rules governing the adhesion promotion of CNTs against roughness by increasing the effective contact area provided by CNT sidewalls. It was achieved by specific design of adhering top based on the rough surface information combined with the advanced tube structure tuning (e.g. CNT length). Furthermore, the design principles was extended to facilitate the double-sided CNT adhesives to hold substrate with distinguishably different roughness (e.g. glass and printing wall), and even three-dimensionally rough stuff (e.g. nickel foam) which is difficult to be accomplished by other adhesives.<br /><br />[1] Xu, M.; Du, F.; Ganguli, S.; Roy, A.; Dai, L.

            Graphene Nanoribbons as a New Semiconductor Family

          <p style="line-height: 18px;">Graphenes and graphene nanoribbons (GNRs), their geometrical cutouts, are new additions to the carbon family. Indeed, graphenes hold enormous promise as materials for energy technologies. GNRs are regarded as a new generation of semiconductors superior to i) silicon in view of the required miniaturization of printed circuits and superior to ii) classical conjugated polymers due to better band structure control. Above all, graphene as a two-dimensional polymer and GNRs are true challenges for materials synthesis.<br /><br />In our &quot;bottom-up&quot; synthesis of GNRs, repetitive cycloaddition in solution is shown to afford branched polyphenylene polymers which serve as precursors for perfectly &quot;graphitized&quot;, solution-processable GNRs as long as 600 nm. An alternative on-surface synthesis utilizes immobilization of suitable monomers and in-situ STM-control of the polymerization to secure structural perfection. A further option is to employ chemical vapor deposition by introducing oligophenylene monomers as initial building blocks. Only these three methods of controlled synthesis ensure sufficient structural precision over, for example, the nature of the edges. Our approach is thus superior to methods of lithiography or unzipping carbon nanotubes.<br /><br />It is a synthetic breakthrough which leads to new materials science and physics. We fabricate field effect transistors from, both, single GNRs and GNR networks and compare the performance with that of conjugated polymers. Of particular importance is the synthesis of GNRs with zig-zag edges because they provide edge localized states. The associated spins reveal long correlation times. These characteristics provide entries to spintronics and even quantum computing.<br /><br />Nature 2010, 466, 470; Nature Chem. 2011, 3, 61; Nature Chem. 2012, 4, 699; Adv. Polym.

          <p style="line-height: 18px;">Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have emerged as promising building blocks for the next-generation electronic devices and chips. Whereas, precise synthesis of semiconducting CNT (s-CNT) condensates with large bandgap is now faced with an obstacle, that slight changes in chiral angles of these tubes may dramatically narrow the bandgap to form metallic CNTs (m-CNTs), giving rise to a disastrous shorting failure in CNT-based devices.<br /><br />We demonstrate the growth of CNTs is a quantum coherent process of life and death. This enables a spontaneous separation of aligned s-CNTs with high purity from m-counterparts when the length exceeds 15.4 cm. Thousand-gate interdigital transistors fabricated on 4-mm-long s-CNT array delivered a high current of 134 µA/µm, with an on/off ratio of 10<sup>2</sup> and the state-of-the-art highest carrier mobility of 4000 cm<sup>2</sup>/Vs, approaching the theoretical limit of CNTs. <br /><br />An in-situ assembly of monochromatic CNT tangles (mono-NTangles) assisted with acoustic-induced vortices can be realized. The two dimensional mono-NTangles can be as large as 2 mm<sup>2</sup>, made of one self-entangled CNT with length up to 150 mm and consistent chirality. The formation of the mono-NTangle in vortices follows minimum dissipative energy model with Strouhal number around 0.3. Transistors fabricated on one mono-NTangle could have more than 1000 channels and an on/off ratio above 1000 at 4 mA on-state current, together with sensitive short wave infrared response. This vortex-induced assembly of decimeter long one dimensional nanotubes into millimeter-sized two dimensional tangles affords new opportunities for facile and scalable fabrication of the next-generation high-performance nano-chips or devices. <br /><br />We show the fabrication of centimeters long CNT bundles (CNTBs) with tensile strength over 80 GPa using ultralong defect-free CNTs. The tensile strength of CNTBs is controlled by the Daniels effect due to the nonuniformity of the initial strains in the components. A synchronous tightening and relaxing strategy is proposed to release the nonuniform initial strains of the CNTB components. For CNTBs consisting of a large number of components with parallel alignment, defect-free structures, continuous lengths and uniform initial strains, the tensile strength is as high as 80 GPa, which is far higher than that of any other strong fibers ever fabricated.</p>

          <p style="line-height: 18px;">Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) are attracting increasing attention as an ideal material for high-performance electronics through the preparation of arrays of purely semiconducting SWCNTs. Despite significant progress in the controlled synthesis of SWCNTs, their growth mechanism remains unclear due to difficulties in analyzing the time-resolved growth of individual SWCNTs under practical growth conditions. Here we present a method for tracing the diverse growth profiles of individual SWCNTs by embedding digitally coded isotope labels [1]. Raman mapping showed that, after various incubation times, SWCNTs elongated monotonically until their abrupt termination. Ex situ analysis offered an opportunity to capture rare chirality changes along the SWCNTs, which resulted in sudden acceleration/deceleration of the growth rate. Dependence on growth parameters, such as temperature and carbon concentration, was also traced along individual SWCNTs, which could provide clues to chirality control. Systematic growth studies of with a variety of catalysts and conditions, which combine the presented method with other characterization techniques, will lead to further understanding and control of chirality, length and density of SWCNTs.<br /><br />Part of this work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Numbers JP25107002, JP15H05760, JP17K06187 and JP17K14601.

          <p style="line-height: 18px;">Together with graphene,<sup>1</sup> conjugated two-dimensional (2D) organic networks have attracted immense interest due to their unusual electronic, optoelectronic, magnetic and electrocatalytic properties. In addition, their tunable structures and properties promise to offer various opportunities in various applications. However, even after years of intensive exploration of 2D materials in science and technology, facile and scalable methods capable of producing stable 2D networks with uniformly decorated heteroatoms with/without holes remain limited. To overcome these issues, new layered 2D fused organic networks have been designed and synthesized (Fig. 1a and 1b). They have uniformly distributed heteroatoms,<sup>2</sup> holes with heteroatoms<sup>3</sup> and transition metal nanoparticles on the holes.<sup>4</sup> The structures were confirmed by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Based on the stoichiometry of the basal plane, they were, respectively, designated C<sub>3</sub>N, C<sub>2</sub>N and M@C<sub>2</sub>N (M = Co, Ni, Pd, Pt, Ru) (Fig. 1c). Their electronic and electrocatalytic properties were evaluated by electrooptical and electrochemical measurements along with density-functional theory (DFT) calculations. The results suggest that these newly-developed 2D organic networks offer promising opportunities, ranging from wet-chemistry to device applications.<br /><br />[1] Novoselov, <i>et</i> <i>al.</i> Science 306, 666 (2004).<br />[2] Mahmood, <i>et</i> <i>al.</i> Nature Communications 6, 6486 (2015).<br />[3] Mahmood, <i>et</i> <i>al.</i> Proceedings of National Academy of Sciences, USA, 113, 7414 (2016).<br />[4] Mahmood, <i>et</i> <i>al.</i> Nature Nanotechnology 12, 441 (2017).<br />[5] Bae, <i>et</i> <i>al.</i> Nature Communications 8, 159 (2017)-Highlighted in Nature Nanotechnology 13, 4 (2018).<br />[6] Mahmood, <i>et</i> <i>al.</i> Angewandte Chemie International Edition 57, DOI: 10.1002/ange.201800218 (2018).</p>

          <p style="line-height: 18px;">The formation of the cap structure determines the chirality of the consequent SWCNT and the addition of the last pentagon can turn the SWCNT into one with any possible chiral angle. Therefore, the random formation of the last pentagon during SWCNT nucleation explains the even distribution of chiral angles in most SWNT samples.<br /><br />During the cap formation, an external bias that affects the addition of the last pentagon may lead to the chirality-selected SWCNT growth. Detailed theoretical and experimental study suggests that the growth of (2n,n)-rich SWNT samples can be achieved by catalyst surface symmetry control. Besides the nucleation stage, varying the chirality during SWNT growth is predicted to be another route towards the chirality-specific SWNTs synthesis. Such a predication has been successfully realized by experimental studies and the synthesized SWNTs show exact chirality distribution as predicated theoretically.</p>

          <p style="line-height: 18px;">Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are anticipated to be the successor to silicon in next generation integrated circuits. However, great challenges to the practical application of this concept include the need to grow horizontal semiconducting CNT (s-CNT) arrays with very high purity, and an efficient method to evaluate the purity. Here we show high throughput methods for evaluating the purity of large area carbon nanotube arrays by using SEM, with the imaging contrast coming from conductivity and bandgap[1-4]. Recently, we found that charge is generated during the CVD growth of CNTs[5-6], which inspired us to use electric field to twists the chirality of the CNTs during synthesis. As a result, nearly-defect-free s-CNTs horizontally-aligned on the substrate have been synthesized with less than 0.1% residual metallic CNT (m-CNT), thus offers a potential pathway to practical applications of CNT nanoelectronics[7].<br /><br />Fig.1 SEM image of the CNTs on quartz changing from bright to dark when the direction of the electric field reversed. This observation corresponds to the chirality change from metallic to semiconducting CNTs.<br /><br />[1] J. Li, Y. He, Y. Han, <i>et</i> <i>al</i>. Nano Letters 12, 4095-4101 (2012).<br />[2] Y.

          <p style="line-height: 18px;">We systematically study the synthesis of carbon nanotube forests by chemical vapour deposition aiming at fully controlling nanotube growth at temperatures below 450 °C. This is the allowed thermal budget for microelectronic and device manufacturing technologies. Using ultra-thin films of purely metallic Fe or Co along with process decoupling (catalyst formation/activation from nanotube nucleation/growth), we demonstrate it is possible to grow forests at temperatures as low as 375 °C. Of equal importance, the tubes appear to grow with very good alignment and well-graphitized walls. To accomplish this, it is essential to fully reduce the catalyst in ammonia (for proper activation) and finely control the amount of carbon source supplied, as low temperatures tend to easily lead to catalyst deactivation. On this basis, we propose a manufacturing process technology capable of producing nanotube forests employing microelectronic-compatible conditions, so it would allow direct nanotube integration into devices. The key requirement is to deposit the metal catalyst and proceed to restructuring into nanoparticles (and further nanotube growth) without exposition to air, hence avoiding metal oxidization. The typically high temperatures reported in the literature (600-800 °C) are largely related to the need of reducing the catalyst to purely metallic state. On the other hand, at temperatures as low as 375 °C, catalyst surface diffusion is, too, virtually negligible, and, as a result, the tubes grow with much more homogenous diameters and a narrow distribution of chiral angles, averaging seven to nine different chiralities per sample. Although the number of chiral angles is steadily observed to be below ten, further improvement appears to be extremely challenging to achieve. The essential level of narrowness in catalyst size and size-distribution requires nanoparticle control are at the very atomic level. However, that in itself exceeds the limits offered by the physical deposition methods usually employed to deposit the catalyst.</p>

          <p style="line-height: 18px;">Semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) with tunable bandgap are regarded as an ideal candidate for nanoelectronics applications. However, the semiconducting SWNTs obtained from traditional chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method usually have diverse structures. We herein reported a kinetic evolution growth method to enrich (n, n-1) semiconducting carbon nanotubes with tunable band gap by modulating the size of the ferromagnetic metal solid catalysts. At the low concentration of carbon source, the six-fold (1 1 1) face of ferromagnetic metal solid catalysts with certain size was served as the template for the nucleation of (n, n) tubes with three or six-fold. Due to the growth kinetics, (n, n) cap was forbidden to continue cyclic growth for the large barrier to create a new kink and has to change to (n, n-1) tube through the formation of 5|7 or 7|5 defects. Finally, (n, n-1) carbon tubes with small bandgaps, such as (13, 12), (15, 14), (16, 15) and (18, 17), could be enriched with abundance of 88.2% on quartz substrate using large size Co solid catalysts (2.4~3.6 nm) at 850<sup>o</sup>C, and (10, 9) tubes with large bandgap were enriched about 83% at 650<sup>o</sup>C. This design offers a new strategy for selective growth of fully semiconducting SWNTs with tunable band gap.</p>

          <p style="line-height: 18px;">We have recently developed a controlled vacuum filtration technique to fabricate wafer-scale &quot;crystalline&quot; films (1 inch [1] or 2 inches [2] in diameter) of highly aligned and densely packed single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs). We have further built unique SWCNTs architectures and devices by stacking and doping these aligned films. In this talk, we summarize our recent accomplishments using these unique samples. We have observed intersubband plasmons (ISBPs) in gated and aligned SWCNT films [3]. For parallel polarization, interband exciton absorption peaks disappeared as carriers were injected, whereas, for perpendicular polarization, a new peak due to an ISBP appeared and grew as the carrier density increased. We have also made the first direct observation of a cross-polarized exciton peak in optical absorption spectra for an aligned undoped (6,5) film [4], which allowed us to quantitatively estimate the oscillator strength of this transition and the effective dielectric constant of this film. We further built an exciton-polariton architecture by incorporating an aligned (6,5) film inside a Fabry-Pérot microcavity. This system displayed a continuous transition from the ultrastrong-coupling regime to the weak-coupling regime through facile polarization control [5]. The obtained dispersion surfaces revealed the existence of two equienergy arcs in momentum space that are bounded by exceptional points. Furthermore, the vacuum Rabi splitting exhibited cooperative enhancement when the number of excitons was increased by increasing the SWCNT film thickness. Finally, we have recently demonstrated that aligned SWCNTs work as hyperbolic thermal emitters that are stable at temperatures greater than 100 K [6]. Aligned SWCNT films exhibited polarized thermal emission with a spectral peak near the epsilon-near-zero frequency, while deeply sub-wavelength-sized cavities showed resonantly enhanced midinfrared radiation.<br /><br />[1]X.

          <p style="line-height: 18px;"> Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) attract wide attention for their unique physical and chemical properties due to their peculiar tubular morphology formed by the curved graphene layers. The one-dimensional nanochannels can be utilized as nanoscale containers for a series of materials and as nanoscale reactors for chemical reactions. Frequently, the nanotubes and the confined substances exhibit different properties from their respective mother parts due to the host-guest interaction, and hence resulting in nanocomposites with new properties which are not accessible by other means. For example, encapsulated metal-based (metal, metal oxide or metal carbide) nanocomposites in the form of discrete NPs or nanowires were demonstrated with potentials for applications in catalysis, electrochemical energy storage, nanoelectronics, nanomedicine, and etc. Likewise, the chemical reactions confined within the nanotube channels also differ from those in the bulk. It was theoretically predicted that the confinement effects on metal nanoparticles become stronger with the decreasing diameter of CNTs and reach a maximum with a nanotube inner diameter of ~ 1 nm. However, introduction of metal nanoparticles particularly non-precious metals, within nanotubes with inner diameter smaller than 2 nm remains a challenge. <br /><br />In this study, we report a versatile method which is applicable for encapsulating various non-precious metal NPs including Mo, W, V, Mn, Fe, Co inside SWNTs with a diameter of 1-2 nm in the form of oxide, metallic and carbide states. The key lies in a small trick, i.e. oxidation treatment following evaporation of volatile cycloalkene metal carbonyl complexes precursors, at a temperature below their sublimation points. Studies reveal that over 95% nanotubes have been occupied by metal NPs within the channels following this method. This allows studies on their properties and the unique behavior of the catalysts within confined nanochannels, for instance in hydrogen evolution and ammonia synthesis.</p>

          <p style="line-height: 18px;">The structure-controlled growth of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) is an important issue for their advanced applications. The catalysts play an essential role in controlling the structure of the SWNTs [1, 2]. Revealing the role of catalyst in the working environments is crucial for understanding the controlled growth mechanism. We developed a family of tungsten-based intermetallic compounds for chirality specific growth of CNTs. The W<sub>6</sub>Co<sub>7</sub> intermetallic have high melting points (2400 <sup>○</sup>C) and very special crystal structures, acting as the structural templates with designed structures for growing CNTs [3, 4].<br /><br />Here, we demonstrated the structural and chemical stability of W<sub>6</sub>Co<sub>7</sub> intermetallic catalysts when feeding with carbon at high temperature (700-1100 <sup>○</sup>C). This was made possible by the use of aberration-corrected environmental TEM (ETEM) and <i>in</i> <i>situ</i> synchrotron ambient-pressure X-ray absorption spectroscopy that can be employed to obtain atomic structure and chemical coordination of both individual and entire catalyst nanoparticles. Both carbon caps and SWNTs were found to nucleate on the solid W<sub>6</sub>Co<sub>7</sub> nanoparticle with stable crystalized structure. For the Co catalysts, the coexistence of liquid-solid region in Co particles was observed from an aberration-corrected ETEM during the carbon feeding. We proved that the metallic Co and Co<sub>3</sub>C carbides are both essential for the nucleation and growth of SWNTs. The growth modes of tubes on solid W<sub>6</sub>Co<sub>7</sub> and transitional monometal catalysts are also compared.<br /><br />[1] V. Jourdain and C. Bichara.

          <p style="line-height: 18px;">As the only soluble form of elemental carbon, fullerenes can be accurately characterized with single crystal crystallography, one of the most powerful tools for atomic-resolution structural studies. Meanwhile, the sub-nanometer cavity of fullerenes is an deal platform to host a variety of metal atoms or metallic clusters, forming endohedral metallofullerenes (EMFs).<sup>1</sup> Charge transfer from metal to cage in EMFs is critical to the stability of the resultant hybrid molecules and even to the chemical reactivity of the cage carbon atoms. During the last few years, results relating to the molecular structures, chemical properties and formation mechanism of EMFs have added new insights into modern coordination chemistry. For instance, it is discovered that the coordination behaviors of the encapsulated metal ions in the comfined sub-nanometer space of the cages are usually different from the situations found in bulky complexes and accordingly some materials show interesting properties and potential applications in different fields.<sup>2,3,4 </sup><br /><br />[1] X.

            Optical and Thermoelectric Properties of Fermi Level Tuned and Aligned Single Wall Carbon Nanotube Thin Films

          <p style="line-height: 18px;">Single wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) are one-dimensional materials with sharp van Hove singularities. Preparation of SWCNTs with a selected electronic structure, fabrication of their aligned thin films[1] and tuning their Fermi level allow us to reveal unique phenomena, which cannot be observed or correctly understood in conventional SWCNT random networks. For example, we observed anomalously large optical absorption for perpendicular polarization to the tube axis in highly doped aligned SWCNTs, which is related to intersubband transition plasmon phenomena in SWCNTs.[2] In this talk, first I discuss the background of this unique properties.<br /><br />Next, I discuss interesting thermoelectric phenomena in fermi level tuned and aligned SWCNTs. In our society, a large amount of heat at relatively low temperature, which is emitted from factories, houses, human bodies, and so on, is left unused. Development of high-performance flexible thermoelectric devices is crucial to efficiently convert such unused waste heat into electric power. Understanding of relationships between electrical conductivity s, Seebeck coefficient S, and thermal conductivity k in thin films of flexible materials and tuning of these parameters is of great importance to improve the performance. SWCNTs are a model of one-dimensional flexible materials, and will play important roles for realization of high-performance flexible thermoelectric devices. Since the seminal study by Hicks and Dresselhaus,[3] the thermoelectric properties of low dimensional materials have been intensively studied, but it still has been of great importance to experimentally clarify how the one dimensional electronic structures can influence and enhance its thermoelectric properties. For flexible thermoelectric applications, we must evaluate the thermoelectric properties in a thin film situation of the materials. Although the thermoelectric properties in a single rope situation of the materials are well understood, thermoelectric properties in the form of thin films are still under discussion. For example, in conventional solid metallic materials, there is a trade off between <i>S</i> and <i>s</i>, such as increase of <i>S</i> leads to decrease of <i>s</i>, however, in the case of SWCNTs sometimes we can observe the breaking of the trade-off.[4] Moreover, it is not clear whether the Wiedemann-Franz law is applicable in thin films. Femi level tuned and aligned SWCNTs allow us to investigate the details of the background because we can systematically change the electronic structure, location of Fermi level, and conditions of contacts between the tubes. In this talk, I will present recent our results about thermoelectric properties of Fermi-level tuned and aligned SWCNTs and discuss how electronic structure, location of Fermi level, current with respect to the tube axis influence on the S, s of SWCNT thin films.<br /><br />Acknowledgment: K.Y. acknowledges support by JST CREST through Grant Number JPMJCR17I5, Japan <br /><br />References:<br /><br />[1] He et al., Nat.

          <p style="line-height: 18px;">Abstract:<br /><br />When the characteristic length of a material shrinks to 1 nm scale, many distinct physical phenomena, such as quantum confinement, enhanced many-body interactions and strong van der Waals inter-material couplings, will appear. To investigate the related fascinating low-dimensional physics, we need a tool to quantitatively link the atomic structures to the physical properties of these very small nano-materials. In this talk, I will introduce our recently developed in-situ TEM + high-sensitive ultrafast nano-optics technique [1], which combines capability of structural characterization in TEM and property characterization in nano-optics on the same individual nanomaterials. Several examples of using this technique to study the 1D carbon nanotube system will be demonstrated [2-3].<br /><br />References:<br /><br />[1] Kaihui Liu, Xuedong Bai, Enge Wang, and et al. &quot;Chirality-Dependent Transport Properties of Double-Walled Nanotubes Measured in Situ on Their Field-Effect Transistors&quot;, JACS 2009, 131, 62<br />[2] Kaihui Liu, Xiaoping Hong, Enge Wang, Feng Wang and et al. &quot;Systematic Determination of Absolute Absorption Cross-section of Individual Carbon Nanotubes&quot;, PNAS 2014, 111, 7564.<br />[3] Tao Jiang, Hao Hong, Kaihui Liu, Shiwei Wu and et al. &quot;Probing Phonon Dynamics in Individual Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes&quot;, Nano Letters 2018, 18, 2590</p>

          <p style="line-height: 18px;">Over the last two decades the optical microscopy of single molecules has been crucial for many applications, in particular in biology. It allows a sub-wavelength localization of an isolated nano-object and a subtle probing of its spatio-temporal nano-environment such as in cells and in biological tissue [1]. However, for many bio-applications, near infrared nanoprobes and/or more photostable nanoprobes than conventional fluorescent molecules or quantum dots would be desirable [2]. In this context, luminescent single walled carbon nanotube tubes are unique due to their unusual dimension, optical properties and rigidity. A prerequisite to the application of carbon nanotubes in high-resolution bio-imaging is however to understand their fundamental optical properties which are based on subtle and sensitive excitonic processes [3] but also to study their rheological/interaction behavior in crowded bio/cellular environments [4] and finally to optimize their optical detection in specific biological environments [5]. Our continuous efforts toward achieving these different goals will be presented as well as recent applications for imaging the brain at the nanoscale [6].<br /><br />[1] Heine et al Science, 320, 5873 (2008) 201-5; A.

            Cardiovascular disease as a (nano)particle-induced occupational disease

          <p style="line-height: 18px;">Epidemiological studies link inhalation of particles to increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Inhaled particles may induce cardiovascular disease by several different mechanisms including translocation of particles to systemic circulation, activation of airway sensory nerves resulting in autonomic imbalance and particle-induced pulmonary inflammation and acute phase response. The acute phase response is the systemic response to acute and chronic inflammatory states caused by for example bacterial infection, virus infection, trauma and infarction. It is characterized by differential expression of ca. 50 different acute phase proteins including C-reactive protein (CRP) and Serum amyloid A (SAA). Blood levels of CRP and SAA are closely associated with risk of cardiovascular disease in epidemiological studies. The acute phase protein SAA is causally related to atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. Overexpression of SAA leads to increased plaque progression and inhibition of SAA synthesis leads to lowered plaque progression in APOE -/-mouse models [1]. We have shown that inhalation and airway exposure to different particles induces pulmonary acute phase response in mice [2]. The pulmonary acute phase response correlates with the total surface area of the deposited particles, neutrophil influx into the lung and with blood concentrations of acute phase proteins. In a recent controlled human exposure study, inhalation of ZnO particles induced systemic acute phase response in a dose-dependent manner at doses well below the current occupational exposure limit in many countries [3]. This calls for re-evaluation of the current occupational exposure limits taking risk of cardiovascular disease into account and underscores cardiovascular disease as an occupational disease [4].<br /><br />References<br /><br />[1] J.C.Thompson, P.G.Wilson, P.Shridas, A.Ji, B.M.de, F.C.de Beer, N.R.Webb, L.R.Tannock.

          <p style="line-height: 18px;">Cancer has become the leading cause of death. The number of them who die each year from the disease could reach seventeen million. Nanomedicines hold great promise in biomedical applications especially in cancer therapeutics. The contemporary use of nanomedicines for cancer treatment has been largely limited to serving as carriers for existing therapeutic agents. Here, we provide definitive evidence that, the metallofullerenol nanomaterial Gd@C<sub>82</sub>(OH)<sub>22</sub>, while essentially not toxic to normal mammary epithelial cells, possesses intrinsic inhibitory activity against triple-negative breast cancer cells. Gd@C<sub>82</sub>(OH)<sub>22</sub> blocks epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition with resultant efficient elimination of breast cancer stem cells (CSCs) resulting in abrogation of tumor initiation and metastasis. In normoxic conditions, Gd@C<sub>82</sub>(OH)<sub>22</sub> mediates these effects by blocking TGF-β signalling. Moreover, under hypoxic conditions found in the tumor microenvironment, cellular uptake of Gd@C<sub>82</sub>(OH)<sub>22</sub> is facilitated where it functions as a bi-potent inhibitor of HIF-1α and TGF-β activities, enhancing CSC elimination. These studies indicate that nanomaterials can be engineered to directly target CSCs. Thus, Gd-metallofullerenol is identified as a kind of non-toxic CSC specific inhibitors with significant therapeutic potential.</p>

            Effective theory for the twisted bilayer graphene

          <p style="line-height: 18px;">The recent discovery of the superconductivity and strongly correlated insulating state in the twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) attracts enormous attention [1,2]. TBG is a sandwitch of two graphene layers stacked with a rotational orientation [Fig.1(a)]. There a slight rotation gives rise to a long-period moiré pattern, substantially modifying the electronic property. Due to the huge moire pattern, the unit cell of TBG includes more than 10,000 carbon atoms. It is a challenging problem to theoretically describe the many-body physics in such a complex system. Here we develop an effective theory to describe the many-body physics in TBG [3]. By using the realistic band model and with the aid of the maximally localized algorithm, we construct the Wannier orbital, which works as the effective composite &quot;atom&quot; on the moiré pattern. The effective atomic orbital has a characteristic three-peak structure [Fig.1(b)], and it leads to unexpected properties of many body states. For example, we find that an electronic excitation can be viewed as a pair creation of the fractional charges in units of e/3, which would possibly give rise to exotic physics. Our effective model dramatically reduces the fundamental complexity of the electronic system in TBG, and it would be greatly beneficial to future theoretical studies. It opens the way to explore the many-body physics in TBG.<br /><br />[1] Y. Cao, <i>et</i> <i>al</i>, Nature 556, 43 (2018).<br />[2] Y. Cao, <i>et</i> <i>al</i>, Nature 556, 80 (2018).<br />[3] M.

          <p style="line-height: 18px;">Since 25 years, significant progress has been achieved in the controlled synthesis of Single Walled Carbon Nanotubes (SWNTs), but we are still facing difficult issues concerning the yield and selectivity of their synthesis by Catalytic Chemical Vapor Deposition. The choice of a catalyst is critical, and hitherto made by trial and error. In fact, we don't know what are the required properties of a &quot;good&quot; catalyst for a selective SWNT growth. Here, we answer this question by developing a statistical thermodynamics model, that in the case of a perpendicular growth, enables to relate the stable (n,m) tube structure, to the tube/catalyst interfacial energies for zigzag and armchair edges and the temperature. This model shows that, at low temperature, only zigzag or armchair tubes should be stable. Chiral tubes become stable at higher temperature because of the configurational entropy of the tube edge, that is indeed the key element of the model. This enables to produce chiral stability maps or &quot;chirality phase diagrams&quot; that enable to understand under which conditions, a near armchair distribution can be obtained, and accounts for the temperature evolution of the chiral distributions reported in a number of experiments.<br /><br />The model, its relevance, usefulness, implications on our understanding of SWNT growth mechanisms, and possible improvements will be discussed</p>

          <p style="line-height: 18px;">Monolayers of semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) build a new class of atomically thin two-dimensional materials. They exhibit a remarkably strong Coulomb interaction giving rise to the formation of tightly bound excitons. In addition to regular bright excitonic states, there is also a variety of dark states that cannot be accessed by light due to the required momentum-transfer or spin-flip. To model the exciton physics in TMD monolayers, we apply a microscopic approach combining semiconductor Bloch equations with the Wannier equation providing access to time- and momentum-resolved optical response and the non-equilibrium dynamics in TMDs. In this talk, we review our recent work focusing on:<br /><br />(i) Uncovering the full exciton landscape including bright as well as momentum- and/or spin-forbidden dark excitonic states [1].<br />(ii) Demonstrating signatures of dark excitonic states by probing the intra-excitonic 1s-2p transition directly after optical excitation and after exciton thermalization [2].<br />(iii) Activating momentum-forbidden dark excitonic states via efficient coupling with molecules suggesting a dark-exciton-based sensing mechanism for molecules [3].<br />(iv) Providing a fully quantum mechanical description of formation, thermalization, and photoemission of interlayer excitons in TMD-based heterostructures [4,5].<br /><br />[1] E.

            Raman spectra by circularly polarized light in 2D materials

          <p style="line-height: 18px;">Resonant Raman spectroscopy of graphene and other two-dimensional (2D) materials have been investigated intensively for characterizing the multilayer 2D structure and their electronic structure [1]. However, it is not so well-known that circularly polarized light (CPL) change its helicity for some phonon modes in the 2D materials in which the helicity of light is defined by 1 or -1 for left or right handness (σ+ or σ- ) of the CPL, respectively. For example, in the Raman spectra of G-band of graphene at 1585cm-1, the CPL changes its helicity in the scattered light from the incident light as shown in Fig.1. In the transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD), on the other hand, although the in-plane Raman active mode changes the helicity, the out-of-plane Raman active mode does not change the helicity. Thus it is a natural question why the helicity changes in some Raman scattering. Since a photon of CPL has angular momentum of +ℏ or −ℏ, the scattered light gets an angular-momentum quanta of ±2ℏ from the 2D materials in the Raman scattering in the case of the helicity-changing Raman scattering. Thus we will start our discussion from the classical Raman tensor and the conservation law of angular momentum in the Raman scattering processes [2]. There are three sub-processes in the Raman scattering, (1) optical absorption, (2) emission of a phonon, (3) emission of a scattered photon [3]. In particular, in optical absorption and emission, the electron can excite by CPL only at one of the two valleys (valley is defined by energy bottom (maxima) of conduction (valence) energy band), which is known as optical valley-polarization [4]. Combining the phenomena of helicity-changing Raman spectroscopy with optical valley-polarization, we calculated resonant Raman intensity of TMDs by first principles calculation [5]. In the presentation, we will discuss origin of the helicity changing Raman spectra based on the calculated results.<br /><br />[1] R. Saito, Y. Tatsumi, S. Huang, X. Ling, M. S. Dresselhaus, J. Phys.

            Hexagonal Boron Nitride in the Class of 2D Materials: Luminescence Properties

          <hr/>
          <p style="line-height: 18px;">Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is a wide band gap semiconductor (&gt; 6 eV) of the 2D materials family, which is rapidly growing around graphene. Bulk hBN exhibits unusual optical properties. It presents a high luminescence efficiency in the deep ultra-violet range [1] despite an indirect electronic structure [2]. Recently, hBN has also become a strategic material in the fabrication of van der Waals heterostructures. Stacked with graphene and/or transition metal dichalcogenides, it can reveal the best of their physical properties [3,4]. As a key material for 2D heterostructures, it is therefore crucial to better understand hBN intrinsic properties and to capitalize them for developping relevant characterization spectroscopic techniques.<br /><br />This talk will review recent advances made thanks to the development of appropriate spectroscopies to the UV range - cathodoluminescence (CL) at 4K, [5,6] angular resolved low loss EELS [7] and Raman spectroscopy [8] - combined with ab initio simulations and tight binding modeling [9,10]. We shall address in particular the long-time debate on the excitonic origin of hBN luminescence, following our previous studies on the impact of defects [6] and layer confinement on the luminescence properties [11]. The efficiency of excitonic radiative recombinations is compared for different hBN sources, ranking them in terms of crystallinity and purity [12]. Thanks to the spectral calibration of the set-up, we performed a quantitative analysis of the excitonic luminescence efficiency in a reference hBN crystal and evidenced a remarkable high value, almost two orders of magnitude higher than for diamond, although both materials present indirect bandgaps [13]. Contrary to diamond and ZnO, the hBN luminescence efficiency remains stable up to room temperature, consistently with tightly bound excitons. Ab initio calculations of the exciton dispersion in bulk hBN confirm that the luminescence is related to an indirect exciton, with a theoretical binding energy equal to 300 meV in agreement with the observed thermal stability of luminescence and standing 100 meV below the direct exciton [13].<br /><br />The benefits of these findings will be shown to solve the long-standing debate on the Stoke shift in bulk hBN [13] and will be discussed for accounting low dimensionality effects observed in few atomic layers [11]. Beyond fundamental issues on the excitonic processes in lamellar crystals, these results highlight CL as a relevant characterisation [12] to accompany the integration of hBN in van der Waals heterostructures.<br /><br />[1] K.

          <p style="line-height: 18px;">Recently, metal-free carbon-based nanomaterials attracted a lot of attention due to their potential in catalyzing several key reactions for energy conversion, especially hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). To accelerate the search for high-efficiency carbon-based catalysts, a deep understanding of physicochemical principle of the catalytic processes is required. Here, we present our recently work on underlying mechanisms governing HER processes, by investigating doping, curvature, spin, surface chemistry as well as solvation effects. For HER on MXenes, we have proposed a new descriptor with better performance compared to previous ones, which could help the fast screening of high-performance HER catalysts. [1] Further analysis based on Pourbaix diagrams shows that surface chemistry on Mo<sub>2</sub>C during the catalytic process plays a key role in determining their performance. [2] These results offer useful theoretical insight to catalytic properties on C-based nanomaterials, which may facilitate the design of metal-free carbon-based catalysts.<br /><br />[1] <i>Chem.</i> <i>Mater.</i> (2018)<br />[2] Unpublished.</p>

          <p style="line-height: 18px;">In-situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) method is powerful in a way that it can directly correlate the atomic structure with physical and chemical properties. By using the homemade in-situ TEM holders, the properties at nanoscale under various physical stimuli have been studied, including mechanical, electrical, and optical properties. For example, the physical properties of individual carbon nanotubes with known chirality have been reported previously. For this work, the real-time imaging of solid state electrochemical processes at atomic scale has been carried out by in-situ TEM. In this presentation, we will review our progress on the studies of phase transition mechanism of the two-dimensional layered transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) by alkali metal intercalation.</p>

          <p style="line-height: 18px;">We propose a conceptually new structure, in which mono- or few-layer hexagonal BN seamlessly wrap around a single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT), and result in an atomically smooth coaxial tube consisting two different materials, as shown in Fig. 1. The structure is synthesized by chemical vapor deposition (CVD), and the length of the coaxial tubes can reach up to micrometers. As the reaction occurs on outer surface of the existing SWCNTs, we name this process conformal CVD. Various SWCNTs, e.g. vertically aligned array, horizontally aligned arrays, suspended SWCNTs, random networks and films, are employed as the starting material, and successful coating are achieved on all of them. Our characterizations confirm that the outside BN coating started locally on the wall of a SWCNT and then merged into a BN nanotube on the curved surface of the SWCNT which served as a template. The thinnest inner SWCNT that can support the BN layer growth is found to be 0.6-0.7 nm. The number of walls can be tuned from 1 to few by controlling the CVD condition. The structure of inside SWCNTs are almost not effected by the conformal CVD, as evidenced by Raman and many other characterizations. The crystallization and cleanness of the starting SWCNT template are believed to be critical for the successful fabrication of outside walls. This structure is expected to have a broad interest and impact in many fields, which include but not limited in investigating the intrinsic optical properties of environment-isolated SWCNTs, fabricating BN-protected or gated SWCNT devices, and building more sophisticated 1D material systems.</p>

          <p style="line-height: 18px;">Carbon nanotube (CNT)-based electronics has been considered one of the most promising candidates to replace Si complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology, which will soon meet its performance limit. In particular CNTs have been investigated for various electronic and optoelectronic device applications, such as sub-10nm CMOS devices which outperform that of state-of-the-art Si based CMOS devices in both speed and power consumption [1-5], as well as idea material for monolithic optoelectronic integration with complementary MOS-compatible signal processing circuit [6-8].<br /><br />Prototype device studies on individual CNTs revealed that CNT based devices have the potential to outperform Si CMOS technology in both performance and power consumption. With a well-designed device structure and in combination with graphene, it is showed that high-performance top-gated CNT FETs with a gate length of 5 nm can be fabricated. A scaling trend study revealed that sub-10 nm CNT CMOS FETs significantly outperform Si CMOS FETs. In particular, the 5 nm CNT FETs approach the quantum limit of FETs and involve only approximately one electron per switch. The contact length of the CNT CMOS devices has been scaled down to sub-10 nm, and the smallest CMOS inverter yet reported with a total pitch size of 240 nm is demonstrated. These results show that CNT CMOS technology has the potential to substantially outperform that of Si when approaching the quantum limits of a binary logic switch and to extend mainstream CMOS technology in the post-Moore era [1].<br /><br />Significant progress has been made in fabricating carbon nanotube low-power devices. An efficient way to reduce the power is to lower the supply voltage V<sub>DD</sub>, but this voltage is restricted by the 60 millivolts per decade thermionic limit of subthreshold swing (SS) in FETs. A Dirac source (DS) with a much narrower electron density distribution around the Fermi level than that of conventional FETs was recently proposed and demonstrated using CNT to reduce SS [2]. In particular, a DS-FET with a carbon nanotube channel provided an average SS of 40 millivolt per decade over four decades of current at room temperature and high device current. When compared with state-of-the-art Si 14-nanometer node FETs, a similar I<sub>on</sub> is realized but at much lower supply voltage of 0.5 versus 0.7 volts for Si, and a much steeper SS below 35 millivolts per decade in the off-state.<br /><br />High purity semiconducting CNTs have also been used as active channel materials for various optoelectronic de-vices, including light emit-ting diodes and photodiodes [6], and as a general platform for building three-dimensional optoelectronic integrated system [7-8].<br /><br />[1] C.

          <p style="line-height: 18px;">Interacting electrons in three-dimensional metals are described remarkably well by quasi-particles in the Fermi liquid theory. At one dimension (1D), however, Coulomb interactions can modify the electron behavior qualitatively and lead to a new type of electron system—the Luttinger liquid. A Luttinger liquid can exhibit fascinating quantum phenomena distinctly different from conventional metals, such as anomalous correlation function and density of states with power-law scaling and spatially separated collective charge and spin excitations. Single Walled carbon nanotubes provide the ideal platform to explore Luttinger liquid physics due to the strong one-dimensional quantum confinement. I will discuss our combined electrical and optical studies to correlate the unusual electron tunneling and plasmon excitations of a Luttinger liquid. I will also show that distinctly different plasmon behavior emerge in electrically gated metallic and semiconducting carbon nanotubes, which are described by the linear Luttinger liquid and nonlinear Luttinger liquid, respectively.</p>

          <p style="line-height: 18px;">Unique properties of single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) films, such as high porosity and specific surface area, low density, high ratio of optical transmittance to sheet resistance, high thermal conductivity and chemical sensitivity, and tunable metallic and semiconducting properties, open up avenues for a wide range of applications.<br /><br />Here, we report about thin films of high quality SWCNTs produced by aerosol CVD (catalyst floating) method and use them as a key component of different flexible and stretchable electronic devices. The electrical properties of these devices can exhibit excellent characteristics compared to the traditional sensors due to a combination of high elastic moduli and outstanding electrical properties.<br /><br />We report the application of the aerosol synthesized SWCNT thin films as transparent, flexible and stretchable electrodes for electrochemical double-layer capacitor (EDLC). SWCNT films exhibit extremely large specific capacitance (178 F g<sup>-1</sup> or 552 µF cm<sup>-2</sup>), high optical transparency and stability for 10000 charge/discharge cycles. The transparent supercapacitor can be stretched up to 120% elongation with practically no variation in the electrochemical performance during 1000 stretching cycles. For the first time, we report high-performance, stable, low equivalent series resistance (ESR) all-nanotube stretchable supercapacitor (SSC) based on single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) film electrodes and boron nitride nanotube (BNNT) separator.<br /><br />Also, we combined and examined a composite consisting of SWCNTs and tough hydrogels. These structures combine SWCNT film conductivity and transparency with hydrogel stretchability and biocompatibility as novel type of electrically conductive hydrogels. We further demonstrate applications of such structures as skin-like both passive electrodes and active motion sensors. A tactile sensor, a pulsometer and an electrical circuit are fabricated for the demonstration of applicability of SWCNTs in wearable electronics.<br /><br />This work was supported by Skoltech NGP Program (Skoltech-MIT joint project).</p>

          <p style="line-height: 18px;">The optical properties of single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) are extremely sensitive to their external and internal environment. For example, filling the endohedral cavity with water molecules results in characteristic shifts and broadening of both the SWCNTs' radial breathing mode vibrational frequency and their optical (electronic) transitions, as well as a quenching of their emission.[1] Although mostly ignored in literature, solvent ingestion effects are substantial, and can also be used to passivate the nanotube interior, by controlled manipulation of the endohedral environment prior to dispersion.[2]<br /><br />In this work, specific and tunable modification of the optical properties of SWCNTs is demonstrated through the direct encapsulation of guest molecules with widely varying dielectric constants. Over 30 different compounds with static dielectric constant varying from 1.8 to 109 have been encapsulated inside the SWCNTs and their spectroscopic analysis, in comparison to unfilled (empty) SWCNTs, demonstrates experimentally that the general effect of filler static dielectric on the nanotube optical properties corresponds to a monotonic energy reduction (red-shifting) of the optical transitions with increased magnitude for higher dielectric constants.<br /><br />Systematic two-dimensional fitting of the fluorescence-excitation spectra enables the direct comparison of this red shifting as a function of nanotube diameter, modulus and chirality. In addition to these spectral shifts, the filling with dielectric molecules also reveals a general increase of fluorescence intensity with lower dielectric constants, with some fillers approaching the emission efficiencies of empty SWCNTs.<br /><br />Our investigation hence demonstrates a new degree of modulation of the SWCNTs' optical properties by simple endohedral ingestion of various guest molecules.<br /><br />[1] S.

            Influence of Dissolved Oxygen on Defect Introduction to SWCNTs in Ultrasonic Dispersion Process

          <p style="line-height: 18px;">Ultrasonic dispersion process is crucial for getting individually dispersed single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), which is essential for the metal/semiconductor separation and following electronic device applications. A serious problem with this process is that defects are introduced in the SWCNT wall. Here, one can think that dissolved oxygen may promote the defect introduction. In this work, we tried to clarify the effect of dissolved oxygen on the defect introduction to SWCNTs.<br /><br />In this work, for the assessment of defect introduction, a G/D intensity ratio of Raman spectrum was used. SWCNTs produced by electric arc discharge (AP grade, Carbon solutions INC, USA) was used as starting material. Sodium cholate 0.5 wt% aqueous solution was used as solvent, which is easily applied for following separation process. To remove the dissolved oxygen, all equipment was installed in a grove box filled with highly purified N<sub>2</sub> gas. We confirmed that the tip-type sonication quickly degassed dissolved oxygen and replaced to N<sub>2</sub>. As a control, the same experiments were done in air. After the dispersion process, samples were ultracentrifuged for 30 min and upper 80% supernatant was collected. Then we measured Raman spectra of all samples using 488, 532, 633, and 785 nm lasers. Since mean diameter of AP SWCNT is around 1.4 nm, resonance of semiconducting SWCNTs were observed for 488 and 532 excitations. Interestingly, G/D ratio of SWCNTs dispersed in pure N<sub>2</sub> was sometimes lower than that dispersed in air. Because saturated gas concentration in water of N<sub>2</sub> is smaller than that of air (N<sub>2</sub>+O<sub>2</sub>), a &quot;cavitation effect&quot; was lower in pure N<sub>2</sub> condition. Therefore, ultrasonic power was applied to SWCNT more effectively in pure N<sub>2</sub> condition, which causes quicker dispersion but more defects. To see the true effect of dissolved oxygen, therefore, we had to analyze a relationship between the dispersion efficiency and the defect density. Figure 1 shows a relation between G/D ratio and the dispersion efficiency. In pure N<sub>2</sub> condition, G/D ratio was higher for the same dispersion efficiency. This result indicates that the ultrasonic dispersion in pure N<sub>2</sub> is effective to get lower defective SWCNT dispersion.<br /><br />This work was supported by JST CREST Grant Number JPMJCR16Q2, Japan.</p>

            Precise Quantification of Cut Boron Nitride Nanotubes in Liquids

          <p style="line-height: 18px;">Nanotubes are potentially applicable for bio-sensing and intracellular drug delivery. Unfortunately, many related study are based on estimated small quantity of nanomaterials (μg/ml level), which has led to discrepancies in reported literature. For instance, boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) are chemically inert, making them a promising candidate for biomedical applications.1 However, biomedical application of BNNTs are relatively unexplored due to the synthesis difficulty of high-quality BNNTs.2 Reported data so far are derived from defective and low purity BNNTs and far from representable. Here we report on precise quantification of short (&lt;500nm) and high-quality BNNTs with nanotube concentration down to ~1.3 μg/ml at an accuracy as high as 99%. High-quality BNNTs are wide band gap materials (~6 eV with no intra-band absorption)2-3, therefore UV-Vis absorption spectra in the visible range is not applicable for quantification. We propose a novel approach to quantify cut BNNTs by modified UV-vis spectroscopy. High-purity BNNTs (&gt; 99.9 wt%) were grown by catalytic chemical vapor deposition (CCVD).3 The as-grown BNNTs are extracted in distilled water by sonication. The weight of the as-grown BNNTs can be precisely measured in the mg level. The extracted BNNTs was then functionalized with biocompatible PEGylated phospholipid [methoxy-poly(ethylene glycol)-1,2-distearoylsn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N conjugates (mPEG-DSPE, Mol. Wt. 5000) to make them water dispersible.4 As functionalized BNNTs were cut by sonication to a nominal length below ~500 nm without weight lost. The as cut BNNTs were examined by field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) and analyze for their length distribution. These cut BNNTs are then used to generate our UV-Vis calibration curves from mg/ml to μg/ml levels. These calibration curves were further improved by a series of repeatable experiments to refine their accuracy. The accuracy of these curves is verified with another series of cut BNNT samples with a wide range of known concentrations. Our results proven that the refined calibration curves can be used to quantify concentration of cut BNNTs based on selected spectra range at an accuracy as high as 99%. The details of these quantification experiments, and the hemolysis and cell viability test results will be presented in the meeting.

          <p style="line-height: 18px;">Over the last few decades, catalytic chemical vapour deposition (CVD) has matured as a synthetic technique for producing many low-dimensional inorganic nanomaterials, such as carbon nanotubes, graphene and boron nitrides. However, in contrast to carbon nanomaterials, such as graphene and CNTs, little is known regarding the catalytic pathways underpinning CVD synthesis of boron nitride nanomaterials [1]. Here we present a CVD mechanism explaining the self-assembly of boron nitride nanomaterials via boron oxide CVD (BOCVD), using non-equilibrium ReaxFF molecular dynamics simulations. BOCVD involves heating solid B and a metal oxide such as MgO, FeO or Li<sub>2</sub>O, producing B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>to react with a flow of NH<sub>3</sub>to form BNNTs on the walls of the reactor or on catalyst surfaces such as MgO, Fe and Ni [2]. Our simulations show that the initial steps in this reaction involve the isomerization of small B<sub>x</sub>N<sub>y</sub>O<sub>x</sub>H<sub>z</sub>fragments via H transfer. Ultimately this process yields larger species that over time self-assemble into borazine rings (Figure 1(a)), the fundamental structural unit of BNNTs and hexagonal boron nitride. Our simulations also address the key roles played by H<sub>2</sub>O and H<sub>2</sub>partial pressures, the presence of solid-phase catalytic nanoparticles on this mechanism (Figure 1(b)).

            Improved Synthesis of Linear Carbon Chains Inside Carbon Nanotubes

          <p style="line-height: 18px;">Recently we demonstrated synthesis of confined one-dimensional linear carbon chains (LCCs) inside double-walled carbon nanotubes (DWCNTs) with the shortest chains consisting of around 30 carbon atoms (polyyne) and the longest chains with a record length of more than 6000 carbon atoms (carbyne) [1]. The carbyne formation was confirmed by near-field Raman spectroscopy and its property was much tailored by its nanotube host [2]. In this presentation, I will show our recently improved methods, which allows us to control the synthesis of LCCs with different lengths and enhance the filling ratio of the chains. For example, size-controlled single-walled carbon nanotubes used as starting materials were annealed at high-temperature in high-vacuum: Thin inner tubes can be formed first [3], whereas LCCs then synthesized inside new-formed inner tubes. The length distribution of the LCCs can be then tailored by the diameter distribution of host carbon nanotubes [4]. In addition, solvents can be used as additional carbon source to increase the filling ratio of the LCCs [5]. As another example, I will show our new developed method for the LCC synthesis inside individual DWCNT [6], which helps us to easily figure out the configurations and interactions [7] between the LCCs and the host nanotubes.

          <p style="line-height: 18px;">We introduce the industrial scale, ISO 9001:2008 certified direct dry printing (DPP) manufacturing of single walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) based transparent conducting films (TCF) for touch sensors with electrical properties on par with those of ITO-on-PET, and with optical as well as mechanical properties i.e. bendability and flexibility better than those of ITO, metal nanowire and metal mesh [1,2]. All carbon transparent, flexible and stretchable TFT-FETs have been made using percolating SWNT network as the semiconductor and SWNT TCF as the source, drain, gate and interconnect material [3,4], demonstratig capability to produce 3D devicve structures. Studies on the SWNT synthesis from CO with trace amounts of CO<sub>2</sub> using the ferrocene based floating catalyst chemical vapor deposition (FC-CVD) show that SWNT networks consisting of long, clean and highly individualized SWNTs exhibit substantially improved TCF performance [5]. TCFs made from individual tubes with 4 micron mean length show 63 ohms/sq sheet resistance at 90 % transparency. Patterned SWNT-based TCFs show 69 ohms/sq sheet resistance at 97 % transmittance and 29 ohms/sq at 87 % transparency [5]. We present recent results on SWNT (n,m) control in the FC-CVD synthesis processes using ethylene, ethanol and toluene as the carbon sources [6,7]. In addition, we will present current status of industrial manufacturing of SWNT based commercial touch sensor products for the emerging 3D sensor markets. <br /><br />[1] A.

          <p style="line-height: 18px;">The fabrication of macroscopic assemblies of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) such as fibers and films is an essential step towards real applications. All the macroscopic assemblies developed so far exhibited low tensile strengths (≤ 2.5 GPa), and it appeared to be a big challenge to transfer the outstanding properties of individual CNTs to the macroscopic scale. In this presentation, we report a new method for preparing CNT fiber and film and strength improvement to 8.0 GPa with a Young's modulus of 150 GPa, and tensile elongation of 8%. The alignment and packing density of the CNTs in the fiber and film are found to be important factors affecting the mechanical properties. Our CNTs are continuously produced by a spray pyrolysis approach, self-assemble into to a hollow cylindrical assembly in a tube reactor and then condense as a fiber or film on a winding apparatus. This method offers good suitability for scaled up production.</p>

          <p style="line-height: 18px;">Development of advanced energy storage systems such as supercapacitors and rechargeable batteries demands high performance electrode materials. Carbon nanotube (CNT) sponges are bulk aerogel-like materials made from three-dimensionally overlapped multi-walled nanotubes. They are light-weight, highly porous and flexible, with many potential applications such as adsorption, catalysis, sensors and electrodes. In this presentation, I will describe the synthesis method, structural characteristics and unique properties of CNT sponges in the context of macroscopic CNT or graphene-based assemblies. Using the sponge as a three-dimensional isotropic porous template, we have fabricated various hierarchical composite materials with tailored microstructures and interesting properties. Examples include CNT-pseudo polymer composite sponges could serve as compressible electrodes for supercapacitors, CNT-MoS<sub>2</sub> and CNT-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> core-shell sponges act as high-capacity lithium ion battery anodes, and CNT-MOF hybrid networks for lithium-sulfur batteries. CNT sponges thus provide a universal platform for manufacturing functional nanocomposite materials and exploring a wide range of applications particularly in energy and environmental areas.</p>

          <p style="line-height: 18px;">The development of flexible electronics and equipment attracts significant interests in recent years. Carbon materials are one kind of ideal materials for flexible electronics. It is of great importance to explore low cost and scalable preparation approaches for high performance flexible carbon materials-based wearable electronics. Herein, we use carbon materials, including carbon nanotubes, graphene, and natural mass derived carbon (such as silk, celluse) as the key materials and develop a series of flexible wearable sensors, wires and energy devices [1-5]. The hierarchical structures of the carbon materials plays important roles in achieving flexible devices with desired performance. We further demonstrated their applications and show their great potentials for applications in wearable electronics and smart textiles. Our strategy provides new approaches for the low-cost and high performance production of carbon-based flexible and wearable electronic materials, shedding light on their practical applications in next-generation electronics.<br /><br />[1] C.Y.
