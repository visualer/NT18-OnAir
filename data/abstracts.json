The samples were characterized using XRD, FE-SEM-EDS, HR-TEM, XPS, DR-UV-vis, BET, PL, EPR, and UPS. These as-prepared samples were subjected to the photocatalytic degradation of Crystal Violet (CV) under visible light irradiation. Under the optimal synthesized conditions, PbBiO<sub>2</sub>I/GO composites showed greatly enhanced photocatalytic performance in PbBiO<sub>2</sub>I composites. Additionally, the rate constant values of PbBiO<sub>2</sub>I/GO composites are obtained as the maximum degradation rates of 0.1807 h<sup>-1</sup> by using the first-order linear fit of the data, which are much higher than the PbBiO<sub>2</sub>I. The enhanced photocatalytic activity can be attributed to the effective separation of photo-generated carriers driven by the photoinduced potential difference generated at these heterostructures interface, transferof photo-generated electrons through the GO skeleton and favorable well-aligned straddling band-structure from the PbBiO<sub>2</sub>X/GO. The possible photodegradation mechanisms was proposed and discussed in this study.

Although, wood has been replaced by concrete and steel over the years, it is still one of the most common construction materials. Moreover, it is biodegradable and environmentally friendly. Diminishing the drawbacks of wood, such as wettability and flammability may renew the interest in wood as constructing material. The aim of the presented research was to assess the wettability and flammability of wood covered with CNTs. For this purpose, we coated wood with industrial grade multiwall CNTs by drop casting and dip coating methods. The scanning electron microscopy and fluorescence microscopy showed that CNTs may form a uniform layer on wood surface. The water contact angle of balsa wood coated with 0.05 g/m<sup>2</sup> CNTs increased from 75±3º (for pure wood) to 143±3º . Thus, the surface was almost superhydrophobic. However, CNT coated wood placed in high humidity environment did not show significant decrease in water uptake. In order to investigate the influence of CNTs on the flammability of wood a series of tests, such as vertical burning (VB), limiting oxygen index (LOI) and burning in fire tube (FT) were performed<i>.</i> Although CNT coating did not significantly influence LOI or VB, but some fire retardant effect was observed during FT test for CNT covered wood chips.

The unique characteristics of two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials make them highly attractive for a wide range of applications. A variety of approaches have been explored to synthesize and control their size, morphology and crystal structure. Template-directed synthesis represents a convenient and versatile route and both organic and inorganic-based materials are usually employed for this purpose. Since carbon nanotubes (CNTs) can have a wide range of diameters and lengths, their inner hollow cavity can be filled with a large variety of compounds. Furthermore, the presence of CNTs might create synergistic effects with the filling material, resulting in unique properties and superior performance. Despite their interest, the number of reports on single-walled inorganic nanotubes is limited because the formation of their multi-walled counter parts is favored during the synthesis.

From a theoretical point of view, the perturbative calculations of optical response are performed routinely. However, it is well-known various methods for calculation, e.g., the choice between length and velocity gauges, frequently generate different results [1-3].<br /><br />Here, we present a comprehensive review of the differences that arise from the choice of method on the linear and nonlinear optical responses. The responses obtained by using four different methods are compared. The methods stem from the combinations of gauges, i.e., length and velocity, and two ways of evaluating the current density response: directly and indirectly via the polarization density. The invariance of response functions is investigated in two levels of modeling: by including or excluding the electron-hole interaction, i.e. excitonic effect. We derive the expressions for the conductivity tensors by adapting a density matrix approach with and without excitons. As a case study, the linear and nonlinear response functions of hBN monolayers are studied numerically. Our results show that when the electron-hole interaction is ignored, the response functions obtained using the length and velocity gauge methods converge toward an identical result by increasing the number of bands in the calculations. Nonetheless, the length gauge calculations are the most accurate results among all methods for any number of bands [2]. Including the excitonic effects changes the linear and nonlinear responses of hBN monolayers dramatically due to the reduced screening. More importantly, the optical responses obtained by the conventional velocity gauge method do not agree with the length gauge results as shown in Fig. 1 for second-harmonic generation (SHG) of hBN monolayers. Nonetheless, by rewriting the interaction Hamiltonian in the velocity gauge as a series of commutators, a fully gauge invariant response is obtained, c.f. Fig. 1 [3].

Nevertheless, grain boundaries are ubiquitous in large-area as-grown TMD materials and would greatly affect their band structure, electrical transport and optical properties. Therefore, the characterization of grain boundaries is essential for their property engineering and growth optimizing in TMD materials. Although the existence of boundaries can be measured by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) or nonlinear optical microscopy, a universal, convenient and accurate method to detect boundary with any twist angle in large scale is still lacking. Here we report a high-throughput method by mild hot H<sub>2</sub>O etching to visualize grain boundaries of TMDs under optical microscope, while nearly noninvasive to grain domains. This technique utilizes the reactivity difference between stable grain domains and defective grain boundaries as well as the mild etching capacity of hot water vapor. As grain boundaries of two domains with any twist angles are of defective lines, this method enables to visualize all types of grain boundaries unambiguously. And the characterization is based on optical microscope and therefore naturally of large scale. We further demonstrate the successful application of this method to other TMD materials of MoS<sub>2</sub> and WSe<sub>2</sub>. Our technique facilitates the large-area characterization of grain boundaries and will accelerate the controllable growth of large single-crystal TMDs.","poster_num":"PS005"},{"id":"886581","category":"A2","title":"Greatly Enhanced Anticorrosion of Cu by Commensurate Graphene Coating","affl":"Department of Physics","author":["Xiaozhi, Xu","Kaihui, Liu"],"corr_name":"Kaihui, Liu","corr_email":"khliu@pku.edu.cn","content":"A foundation of the modern technology that uses single-crystal silicon has been the growth of high-quality single-crystal Si ingots with diameters up to 12 inches or larger.

Graphene, a monolayer of hexagonal carbon, in principle can be a revolutionary material for anticorrosion due to its excellent impermeability to any molecule or ion (except for proton) and extreme lightness (&gt; 2000 m<sup>2</sup>/g). However, in real applications, it was found that the metallic graphene may form an electrochemical circuit with the protected metals to accelerate the corrosion once the corrosive fluids leaks into the interface. Therefore, whether graphene can be used as an excellent anticorrosion material is under intense debate now. Here, we employ graphene-coated Cu (Gr/Cu) to investigate the facet-dependent anticorrosion of metals. We demonstrate that a monolayer graphene can protect the Cu(111) surface from oxidation in humid air lasting for more than 2 years, while, in sharp contrast with the accelerated oxidation of graphene coated Cu(100) surface. Further atomic-scale characterization and ab initio calculations reveal that the strong interfacial coupling of the commensurate graphene/Cu(111) prevents H<sub>2</sub>O diffusion into the graphene/Cu(111) interface, but the one-dimensional wrinkles formed in the incommensurate graphene on Cu(100) could facilitate the H<sub>2</sub>O diffusion at the interface.

The transparent and conducting wafer scale material is of interest as membrane, coating, for generation and detection of light, or strain sensing [1,2]. In this work, we study the formation of nanocrystalline graphene on Germanium, a surface which promotes the CVD synthesis of monocrystalline graphene [3]. The surprising result that we obtained through graphitization is the formation of cavities in Germanium, over which nanocrystalline graphene is suspended. Depending on the crystallographic orientation of the Germanium surface, either trenches in (110)-Ge or pits in (111)-Ge are formed, and their dimensions depend on the graphitization temperature. By Raman spatial imaging, we can show that nanocrystalline graphene is formed across the entire wafer in spite of the cavity formation. Interestingly, the Raman intensity is suppressed when the material is supported by Germanium and is enhanced when the material is suspended. Through simulations, we can show that these effects are induced by the high refractive index of Germanium and by interferences of the light field depending on the spacing between graphene and Germanium. Using atomic force and scanning electron microscopy, we determined that ripples in the suspended material are induced by the mismatch of thermal expansion coefficients.

However, there is still a limit to the efficiency due to 1) the CNT back electrode not being reflective to absorb the reflection of sunlight, and 2) CNTs having lower conductivity than metals.<br /><br />In this work, we employed a 3D/2D formamidinium lead iodide (FACsPbI<sub>3</sub>) photo-active layer to maximise the light absorption and trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (TFMS) vapour doping to increase the conductivity of the CNT electrodes. In metal-electrode PSCs, the long-wavelengths of sunlight, which are not fully absorbed by the perovskite layer, get reflected by the metal electrode for further absorption. As CNT electrode are not reflective, the long-wavelength light is wasted in the case of CNT-used PSCs, resulting in low short-circuit current density (<i>J</i><sub>SC</sub>). While maximising the light absorption by using low band-gap FAPbI<sub>3</sub>, is possible, FAPbI<sub>3</sub> film has been reported to be extremely unstable.

The application of TFMS-doped CNT in 3D/2D FACsPbI<sub>3</sub> PSCs produced an efficiency of 17.6% owing to increased hole conductivity and a better energy match between the Fermi level of CNTs and the valence level of FACsPbI<sub>3</sub>.

High absorption coefficient, long-range diffusion length and high defect tolerance of PSCs enable remarkable certified power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) over 20%. Although PSCs are proven to be promising next-generation solar devices, further breakthroughs in terms of efficiency and stability are necessary to supersede conventional silicon solar cells. With regard to the performance and stability of PSCs, perovskite grain boundaries play a significant role. Structural disorders at these boundaries induce shallow trap states and non-radiative recombination of localised charge carriers which serve as limitations to PSC performance. At the same time, these areas are also responsible for the perovskite degradation, as the reaction with moisture in air has been found to initiate from the grain boundaries. Therefore, technologies aiming at passivating the perovskite grains are highly desired.<br /><br />Over the last two decades, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with an exceptional charge carrier property with outstanding chemical and mechanical stability have generated a lot of excitement among researchers for their device applicability. Especially, single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) with a certain chirality possess a wide range of direct bandgap of up to 2 eV, qualifying for a light-harvesting medium with strong absorption and high carrier mobility. Semiconducting SWNTs (s-SWNTs) are highly conductive along the tube axis and therefore can function effectively as a charge-transporter between perovskite grains. While there have been a few reports on phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) as a charge-transporter at the grain boundaries of perovskite films, fullerenes have inherently low carrier mobility and low stability compared to SWNTs. It has also been demonstrated that hydrophobic and air-stable SWNTs can protect the perovskite layer successfully from the oxygen and moisture.<br /><br />Here, we fabricated PSCs in a configuration of glass/ITO/SnO<sub>2</sub>/CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbI<sub>3</sub>/spiro-MeOTAD/Au in which the perovskite grains are passivated and connected by s-SWNTs. s-SWNTs here are functioning as a charge-transporter, light-harvester, and protector from the moisture in air. By incorporating a small amount of s-SWNTs in deionised water, 18.0% efficiency of the reference PSCs increased to 20% with reduced hysteresis. due to the increased perovskite grain size arising from favourable vapour pressure of the solvent. Upon addition of s-SWNTs, the PCE further increased beyond 20% with improved hysteresis and air/light stability. Ultimately, s-SWNTs added PSCs showed superior stability over the reference devices.","poster_num":"PA059"},{"id":"890617","category":"S1","title":"Temporal and spatial evolution of hydrocarbons and catalytic precursors in gas phase and on the substrate during CVD growth of carbon nanotubes","affl":"Ecole CentraleSupelec","author":["Delong, HE","Yiguo, Xu","Yang, Ma","Anthony, Dichiara","Laurent, Zimmer","Jinbo, Bai"],"corr_name":"Yiguo, Xu","corr_email":"jinbo.bai@centralesupelec.fr","content":"Single-wall Carbon Nanotubes (SWCNTs) are one of the most exciting materials to have been discovered due to their range of useful and tuneable properties.

Typical metal fillings can corrode and composite fillings (thus far) are not very strong; Graphene on the other hand is 200 times stronger than steel and doesn't corrode, making it a prime new candidate for dental fillings. Graphene can, therefore, be used to make mechanically stronger composite-dental fillings which also do not corrode. Despite some challenges and the fact that carbon nanotubes-polymer composites are sometimes better in some particular performance, graphene-polymer composites may have wide applications in dentistry due to their outstanding properties and the availability of graphene in a large quantity and at low cost. One of the main problems, for patients, associated with dental-polymers is that of location.

The local environment inside a nanotube, characterized by its chirality, strongly affects the encapsulated chains through interactions such as van-der-Waals forces, charge transfer or dielectric screening [2]. However, while the electronic and vibronic properties of the encapsulated chain are governed by its nanotube host, the correspondence between the tube's chirality and the properties of the encapsulated chain has not been investigated experimentally. Here we study individual pairs of double-walled carbon nanotubes and encapsulated linear carbon chains by tip-enhanced Raman scattering (TERS) [3]. We observe that the radial breathing mode (RBM) of the inner nanotube correlates with the frequency of the carbon chain's Raman mode (C-mode) revealing that the nanotube chirality determines the vibronic and electronic properties of the encapsulated carbon chain. As a general trend, the Raman shift and the band gap of the encapsulated long linear carbon chains increases for larger inner carbon nanotube diameters as shown in Figure 1.

Thermal emission is ruled out by monitoring the <i>G</i> band Raman frequency, which shows no evidence of heating under these small electrical currents. The mechanism of light emission is understood on the basis of steep band bending that occurs in the conduction and valence band profiles at the contacts, which produces a peak electric field of 500kV/cm, enabling the acceleration of carriers beyond the threshold of exciton emission. The exciton-generated electrons and holes are then accelerated in this field and emit excitons in an avalanche process. This is evidenced by an extremely sharp increase in the current with bias voltage (45mV/dec). We also observe light emission at negative applied gate voltages when the FET is in its &quot;on&quot; state at comparable electrical powers to those reported previously (~5µW).

The mesoporous carbon materials were synthesis by chemical vapor deposition method because of decomposition of ethylene or toluene on iron doped calcium tartrate catalytic system. These materials are different in morphology, quantity of defects and surface area. The porous carbon produced from ethanol consists of corrugated thin graphitic layers, while toluene-produced carbon comprises multi-layered shells. Here, we study the behavior of Li accumulation in mesoporous carbon materials using in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (NEXAFS). The samples of mesoporous carbon were exposed to Li vapor for 5 min at a current ~ 8 A under ultra-high vacuum and at room temperature. XPS and NEXAFS spectra of the samples were measured right after Li deposition without their exposure to air. The Li-induced changes in the composition and electronic structure of the samples were revealed. The concentration of lithium was estimated to be higher in the porous carbon, which was produced from ethanol, than that from toluene. The Li atoms penetrate more dipper into the carbon material produced from ethanol, than that produced from toluene. The electrochemical measurements and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy were performed on the half-cells with carbon cathode and lithium anode. The porous carbon material produced from toluene (ethanol) possesses average capacities 280 and 170 mA·h·g<sup>-1</sup> (340 and 170 mA·h·g<sup>-1</sup> ) at 0.1 and 1 A·g<sup>-1</sup>. The capacities of the sample produced from ethanol reduced to 290 and 140 mA·h·g<sup>-1</sup> at 0.1 and 1 A·g<sup>-1</sup> after annealing of the sample at 400 °C. According to XPS data, the concentration of the lithium adsorbed on the sample produced from ethanol strongly decrease in the result of its previously annealing at 400 °C. We suggest that the thermal treatment led to the rearrangement of atomic structure, which closed some channels for lithium penetration. This finding provides new insight into the centers of Li storage into the porous carbon and provides recommendations for designing carbon-base anode materials for high-performance Li-ion batteries.

However, current SWCNT production methods tend to give non-uniform products with a distribution of chiralities. The origin of this &quot;distribution of chiralities&quot; have long been a puzzling question, but in recent years several breakthroughs have been made [1-5]. These advances rely on having accurate energies for SWCNTs with different chiralities, lengths and terminations. Such energies are usually calculated using density functional theory (DFT) which gives very accurate energies, but the calculations are time and resource intensive. This limits the size of the systems, chiralities, lengths and terminations that can be studied. Here we present a new analytical model, derived from DFT results, for calculating total energies of SWCNTs. This new model consists of wall, edge and termination energies and can quickly and accurately determine total energies for hydrogen terminated SWCNTs with any chirality and length. Tests against previously published total energies calculated by DFT show the model having excellent accuracy, with a mean absolute error in the total energy below 1.5 meV per atom. The model can also be expanded on to include other terminations such as catalytic metals, by fitting model parameters to DFT results (ongoing work). Our model can calculate total energies of SWCNTs with good accuracy and negligible time consumption, which allows for probing of larger parameter spaces, in order to understand the distribution of SWCNT chiralities found in experimental products.<br /><br />[1] F.

For wide range applications that require various sensitivities and dynamic ranges, appropriate materials that are suitable for each application should be chosen.<br /><br />In this study, we propose a novel pressure sensor, of which sensitivity and sensing range can be easily controlled without changing sensing materials[2,3]. Our sensor is composed of multi walled carbon nanotube (MWNT) networks and a droplet of liquid metal (eutectic Ga-In (EGaIn) alloy) (Fig.1(a)). EGaIn droplet, which is a sensing material, is sandwiched with a MWNT network-deposited paper and a copy paper. By changing the gap of these papers, the shape of EGaIn droplet can be changed. Namely, contact area of MWNT network and the droplet can be tuned. As a result, it is possible to detect the applied pressure by monitoring the resistance change of the MWNT network. In principal, we can control the sensitivity and sensing range by changing the shape of MWNT network and type of spacer in the device, respectively.<br /><br />Figure 1(b) shows a typical sensing property: resistant change vs applied load. We have confirmed that the resistance of MWNT network decreases with decreasing the gap (i.e., increasing the pressure). Sensitivity and resistance change were approximately 3.9 mm<sup>-1</sup> and over 80%, respectively. Because of high lyophobic of EGaIn against both the MWNT network and the copy paper, this sensor can be repeatedly used.

Their physical properties like electrical conductivity suggest a wide area of possible applications. A precondition for the use of CNTs in industry applications is the possibility to obtaing large scale homogeneous thin films. In recent years, there has been an intensive development of research on transparent, horizontally ordered CNT electrodes, that have the potential to replace ITO layers. Langmuir methods allow to obtain relatively large areas layers of CNTs. Despite that the individual CNTs are characterized by good electrical conductivity the resistivity of CNT thin films is too large for practical application. Main reason of the thin films high resistance is the high number of poor conductivity contacts between carbon nanotubes. In current work we present optoelectrical properties of CNT Langmuir-Schaefer thin films and an example of their use. We have shown that the surface resistance is strictly related to the diameter of used CNT [2,3]. Moreover the results show the anisotropic feature of the nanotube layers, both optical and electrical. The differences in electrical and optical properties observed at different directions increase with the increasing surface pressure during the film transfer. The electrical properties were investigated in temperature range 300-40 K for the as deposited and annealed (373 K) CNT thin films. In those films two types of conduction mechanism can be observed: variable range hopping (VRH) and nearest neighbor hopping (NNH) [4]. Moreover, we found that the CNT Langmuir-Schaefer thin films can be used as a ultralight current collector coating in lithium-ion batteries.

Therefore, the capability to precisely produce GNRs with defined chirality at the atomic level is required in order to engineer their band gap and electrical properties. It is obvious that earlier approaches have fundamental limitations for further electronic investigation. Electronics always require scalable transfer-free approaches for growing GNRs and conducting band gap engineering. Controlled fabrication of oriented GNRs embedded on hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) has the capability to overcome the above difficulties. With proper control, the band gap and magnetic properties can be precisely engineered. Most desired features for GNRs can be automatically attained using this approach. Here, we demonstrate the successful growth of GNRs directly on hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) substrates with smooth edges and controllable widths via templated growth using chemical vapour deposition (CVD). The applicability of graphene for future digital devices is often questioned due to its intrinsic gapless nature. Nanoribbons offer a potential solution, but both the width and edges must be precisely controlled. By employing the in-plane epitaxy of graphene in nano-trenches of h-BN, we have realized ZZ-oriented graphene nanoribbons with a controlled width and smooth edges. The GNRs feature a tunable band gap, enabling sub-10-nm GNR FETs with on-off ratios greater than 10<sup>4</sup>.

Larger nanostructures then form <i>via</i> the coalescence of these structures on the catalyst surface, which are stabilised through strong carbon-catalyst σ-bonding [1-3].

Such etchants have been shown to be linked to chirality [8] and diameter [9] control during growth. Our simulations demonstrate how each of these parameters can potentially be exploited towards controlling the growth of graphene and carbon nanotubes. For instance, the presence of trace levels of NH<sub>3</sub> during methane CVD on Fe and Ni nanoparticle catalysts leads to efficient etching of small carbon species and the formation of hydrogen (iso)-cyanide (Figure 1). This is driven by the selective activation of the N-H bond by the catalyst surface. Ultimately however this impedes carbon ring formation during the early stages of carbon nanotube growth, leading to a greater degree of control during synthesis. By contrast, the presence of acetonitrile during methane CVD on Fe and Ni nanoparticle has the opposite effect; rather than reducing carbon it effectively oxidises it via hydrogen abstraction to form hydrogen (iso)-cyanide. This increases the rate of carbon chain oligomerisation and ring formation. It also increases the rate of carbon removal from the catalyst surface, consistent with experimental observations.<br /><br />[1] B. McLean <i>et</i> <i>al.</i>, Phys. Chem. Chem.

There remains a struggling against the trade-off between flexibility and TE performance.

Herein, we present a novel approach to fabricate flexible thermoelectric nanocomposites through depositing M<sub>2</sub>C<sub>3</sub>-based (M=Bi, Sb; C=Te, Se) alloys on single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) scaffold.

The freestanding M<sub>2</sub>C<sub>3</sub> nanocomposite exhibits remarkable mechanically reliable flexibility over hundreds bending circles, of which the bending deformation radius could be as high as a few millimeters. Large power factors of ~1550 to 1100 μW/m·K<sup>2</sup> are obtained for the Bi<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3</sub>/SWCNTs nanocomposite from room temperature (RT) to 473 K. Owing to the high density of defects, such as Bi<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3</sub>/SWCNTs interfaces, stacking faults and nanopores, the in-plane thermal conductivity is as low as ~0.6 W/m·K. Such high power factor and low thermal conductivity give rise to a TE figure of merit (ZT) of ~ 0.9 at RT. Our approach opens up a new way to fabricate flexible TE materials with high performance, which could have promising applications in flexible electronics.","poster_num":"PS019"},{"id":"907483","category":"T","title":"Improving thermoelectric performance of monolayer semiconductors beyond the confinement effect","affl":"Tohoku University","author":["Tuan Hung, Nguyen","Ridwan Tresna Nugraha, Ahmad","Saito, Riichiro"],"corr_name":"Tuan Hung, Nguyen","corr_email":"nguyen@flex.phys.tohoku.ac.jp","content":"Transition metal dichalogenides (TMDs) has excellent optical and electrical properties and is expected to be used in electronics, optoelectronics, catalysis and other fields.

With comprehensive investigation of different dielectric environments and morphologies, we demonstrated that the substrate's increased corrugation is the dominating factor driving the performance enhancement.

This high-speed response is explained by the extremely fast temperature response of the CNT film, which is dominated by the small heat capacity of the CNT film and its high heat dissipation to the substrate. We also demonstrated the high-speed blackbody emitters with graphene on silicon chips. The emission responses of the graphene emitters are strongly affected by the graphene contact with the substrate depending on the number of graphene layers. The observed ultra-high-speed emission can be understood by remote quantum thermal transport via surface polar phonons of the substrates. By using these blackbody emitters with nanocarbon materials, we demonstrated short-pulsed light generation, real-time optical communications, integrated two-dimensional array emitters, capped emitters operable in air, and the direct coupling of optical fibers to the emitters.

Well known problem of this material is that the as-synthesized SWCNT is always a mixture of metallic (M-) and semiconducting (S-) ones and post-purification is necessary. Within this decade anionic surfactant based M/S separation techniques have been highly improved and are very useful as post-purification of SWCNTs. For the M/S separation, however, bundled SWCNTs need to be dispersed into individual forms using ultrasonic dispersion. It is also well known that this process unavoidably generates structural defects on the SWCNTs that degrade device performance. To minimize the defect introduction keeping high dispersion yield, the sonication process has to be optimized. Shirae et al. [1] reported that a repetitive sonication-centrifugation process can produce less-defective and longer SWCNT dispersion suitable for conductive film. For the M/S separation, however, we need individually dispersed SWCNTs, which require stronger sonication and ultracentrifugation process. In this study, therefore, we aimed to obtain highly-dispersed and less-defective SWCNTs using repetitive sonication-ultracentrifugation process.<br /><br />Pristine SWCNTs were sonicated in sodium cholate (SC) aqueous solution for relatively short time and then ultracentrifuged. Supernatant was collected as individually dispersed SWCNT solution. A sediment was dissolved in SC solution again and was used for the second cycle of the sonication and ultracentrifugation. The repetitive sonication-ultracentrifugation process was repeated until the total sonication time reaches 150 min. Fig. 1 shows G/D Raman intensity ratio of each supernatant and the sum of the collected SWCNT as supernatant for 20 and 30 min sonication case. Result for 150 min one-time sonication is also indicated. Clearly, 20 min sample shows higher G/D and higher yield than for 30 min and 150 min ones for any intermediate sonication time. This result strongly suggests that shorter sonication time is better for getting better quality SWCNTs with higher yield. Only one but serious problem is time and effort. We have to further optimize a cost-effective process towards high-performance device applications.

Transition metal chalcogenides (TMCs) are capable of delivering appropriately high energy capacities as anode of sodium ion batteries (SIBs). But, TMCs suffer from poor cycle life and rate capabilities, mainly due to the large volume expansions causing electrode deteriorations and poor conductivities. To address the conductivity and volume expansion issues, we put forward a compelling combination of nano-sized (3-10nm) cobalt selenide (Co<sub>0.85</sub>Se) particles embedded in carbon spheres (CoSe@CSs). Carbon matrix of these spheres acts as support materials to Co<sub>0.85</sub>Se particles, provides necessary space for volume changes and most importantly, offers a conductive path for electron transfer during intercalation/de-intercalation of ions. Due to these features, the CoSe@CSs present excellent electrochemical properties when used as an anode of SIBs. With a stable life of more than 10,000 cycles, CoSe@CSs composite delivered a discharge capacity of 260 mA h g<sup>-1</sup> at 4000 mA g<sup>-1</sup> scan rate. It also exhibits a high discharge capacity (554 mA h g<sup>-1</sup> at 100 mA g<sup>-1</sup> after 50 cycles) and superior rate capability (900 mA h g<sup>-1</sup> at 100 mA g<sup>-1</sup> and 286 mA h g<sup>-1</sup> at 8000 mA g<sup>-1</sup>). Furthermore, binary TMCs with a spinel structure of AB<sub>2</sub>X<sub>4</sub> (where A, B are transition metals and X is chalcogenide) benefit from enhanced intrinsic conductivity and larger crystal structure compared to their mono-metal counterparts (AX<sub>2</sub>). Therefore, a mesoporous structure of such binary metal selenides with carbon modification is expected to be a promising anode for SIBs and rectify above issues. Considering these facts, we designed and synthesized hierarchically porous spheres of nanoparticles of iron cobalt selenide (Fe<sub>2</sub>CoSe<sub>4</sub>) assembled in a carbon matrix (termed as FCSe) in our second study. Due to superior intrinsic conductivity, larger crystal size of binary metal selenide (compared to mono-metal selenide), presence of hierarchical pores, and the existence of intimate contact between nanoparticles of FCSe and carbon matrix, FCSe anode presented outstanding electrochemical properties. The specific capacity of FCSe was as high as 614.5 mA h g<sup>-1</sup> at 0.1 A g<sup>-1</sup> after 100 cycles and when observed at the current rate of 4 A g<sup>-1</sup> the specific capacity still remained 350 mA h g<sup>-1</sup> even after 5000 cycles. Additional to this, the material showed excellent rate capability, i.e. 816.3 mA h g<sup>-1</sup> at 0.5 A g<sup>-1</sup> and 400.2 mA h g<sup>-1</sup> at an extremely high current rate of 32 A g<sup>-1</sup>. Following the outstanding performance of FCSe in half-cell configurations, it was further combined with home-made Na<sub>3</sub>V<sub>2</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>/C cathode in Na-ion full cells to evaluate its commercial significance. A reasonably high and stable specific capacity of 360.2 mA h g<sup>-1</sup> was achieved for Na-ion full cells with a retention of 247.6 mA h g<sup>-1</sup> after 100 cycles (at 0.2 A g<sup>-1</sup>) in the voltage range 0.5-3.0 V. Post cycling morphological analysis prove that the FCSe was able to maintain the spherical shapes after 100 charge/discharge cycles. Overall, these strategies will open up a new way to produce transition-metal based binary-metal selenides for high-rate capability and long-term cyclability for next generation SIBs.","poster_num":"PA013"},{"id":"908215","category":"C1","title":"Moire pattern in encapsulated 2D materials","affl":"Faculty of Engineering and Physical Sciences, University of Manchester","author":["Yibo, Wang","Colin, Woods","Konstantin, Novoselov"],"corr_name":"Yibo, Wang","corr_email":"yibowang622@gmail.com","content":"Gas sensors are devices that able to detect combustible, flammable, toxic gases and widely used in industry or in firefighting. Graphene among large number of materials has been kept key place as a platform for gas sensor due to its combination of electronic and structural features, such as tunable conductivity and high specific surface area and 2D structure [1]. Additionally, unsaturated carbon-carbon bonds in graphene are available for modification with functional groups, which allow tailoring electronic properties in wide range, improve reactivity of graphene and change its charge state [2]. Depending on the type of functional group it is possible to manage energy and charge transfer of interaction with adsorbed molecules, as well as an adsorption equilibrium.<br /><br />In the present work, we investigate sensor properties of covalently modified graphene films, namely fluorinated (FG) and oxyfluorinated (OFG) graphene. Fluorination was performed by reaction of natural graphite with bromine trifluoride/bromine mixture (BrF<sub>3</sub>/Br<sub>2</sub>) at room temperature, which allows controlling chemical composition. Oxyfluorination of graphene was obtained by one-pot synthesis using chromium oxide in the anhydrous hydrofloride. The gas sensor properties of these materials were investigated toward electron-donor (ammonia) and electron-acceptor (nitrogen dioxide) gases. The kinetics and thermodynamics of gas adsorption were evaluated from electric response of the sensor. The obtained results pointed out that functional groups form specific adsorption site for molecule, while adsorption and activation depend on the nature of functional groups and its configuration. It was shown that both material had similar sensitivity, however FG shows lower adsorption energy and adsorption/desorption times at room temperature comparing to oxyfluorinated graphene [3]. Notably, at higher temperatures OFG sensor kept it high performance and kinetic characteristics improved several times. At the operating temperature of 75 <sup>o</sup>C, OFG is usable for reversible adsorption of NO<sub>2</sub> with sensitivity of 9.5%/ppm. The operating temperature for OFG sensor is much lower than it for graphene oxide (150<sup>o</sup>C) [4] or carbon nanotube (100-350<sup>o</sup>C) [5] gas sensor materials. In conclusion, this work has demonstrated that fluorination of graphene is more perspective for gas sensing as compared to oxygenation due to its higher chemical stability and weaker interactions with the adsorbed molecules.

In this context, the bandgap of the nanoribbon is defined by the structure of the edges (zigzag or armchair) and the width of the nanoribbon. However, synthesizing such structures with a controlled morphology is still one of the greatest challenges in this field. In this study we encapsulated terrylene as precursor inside single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and transformed the molecule into nanoribbons via a controlled reaction. The benefit of this approach is that the spatial confinement of the molecule imposed by the SWCNT ensures that it is aligned with respect to the SWCNT axis. After filling the SWCNTs with terrylene, the ends of the molecules connect among each other during a heat treatment forming nanoribbons with the same width as the terrylene molecule. Raman spectroscopy, photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were applied to investigate the filled terrylene molecules and the obtained nanoribbons. The results show that the band gap of the nanoribbon is lower than that of the terrylene, suggesting it has an armchair edge structure. Furthermore, the PL signal of the terrylene shows changes after encapsulation compared to merely terrylene suspended in solvent. More interestingly, the PL of nanoribbon can be identified clearly. In addition, the presence of the nanoribbon also enhances the PL of SWCNTs as hosts. These results strongly suggest that using terrylene as a precursor molecule encapsulated in SWCNTs represents a truly viable pathway to produce width-controlled armchair nanoribbons.","poster_num":"PA014"},{"id":"908583","category":"A2","title":"Simple Method for Removal of Carbon Nanomaterials from Wastewater by Using Hypochlorite","affl":"National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST)","author":["Minfang, Zhang","Yinmei, Deng","Mei, Yang","Hideaki, Nakajima","Masako, Yudasaka","Sumio, Iijima","Toshiya, Okazaki"],"corr_name":"Minfang, Zhang","corr_email":"m-zhang@aist.go.jp","content":"Carbon nanotube (CNT) fibers and yarns have been extensively studied because of their potential abilities to replace conventional electrical and mechanical wires.

Moreover, efficient phonon-assisted up-conversion photoluminescence (UCPL) in SWNTs, for which the excitation light wavelength can be longer than the emission one, has recently been discovered [3]. With regard to the UCPL, the UCPL intensity increases with increasing temperature, while Stokes PL (hereafter, just referred to as PL) intensity decreases [3]. Thus, the temperature dependent variation of the ratio of the UCPL and PL intensities may potentially be useful for optical thermometric imaging applicable to determining the temperature of deep inside of biological tissues. Development of such a new method will facilitate, for instance, the hyperthermia treatment that has been considered to be effective for the treatment of tumors [4]. The hyperthermia treatment requires strict control of the tumor temperature. However, the exact temperature control still remains a challenge because of the difficulty in measuring the temperature of the tumor in deep tissue. Thus, development of an effective method for the deep tissue optical thermometry has been strongly desired.<br /><br />In this study, we observed UCPL and PL of SWNTs that were chemically functionalized in order to enhance both the UCPL from the free excitons and the longer wavelength PL from the localized excitons [5,6], and used the ratio of these intensities to determine the local temperature of deep inside of the biological tissues. The SWNTs were dispersed in water, and it was sealed in a thin circular cell, and their UCPL and PL intensities were measured using an InGaAs near-infrared camera. The temperature of the dispersion was directly controlled using a rubber-heater and a thermostat, and the luminescence images of the UCPL (1000 nm) and the PL (1150 nm) were obtained under epi-illumination using a 1064 nm laser. The PL and UCPL images were obtained under the same temperature, and the UCPL/PL intensity ratio at each spatial position were obtained to construct a ratiometric image. As the temperature of SWNTs increased, the luminance intensity of UCPL (<i>I</i><sub>UCPL</sub>) increased but the PL (<i>I</i><sub>PL</sub>) counterpart decreased. Consequently, the value of the ratio (<i>I</i><sub>UCPL</sub>/ <i>I</i><sub>PL</sub>) increased as shown in Figure 1.

Well known problem of this material is that the as-synthesized SWCNT is always a mixture of metallic (M-) and semiconducting (S-) ones and post-purification is necessary. Within this decade anionic surfactant based M/S separation techniques have been highly improved and are very useful as post-purification of SWCNTs. For the M/S separation, however, bundled SWCNTs need to be dispersed into individual forms using ultrasonic dispersion. It is also well known that this process unavoidably generates structural defects on the SWCNTs that degrade device performance. To minimize the defect introduction keeping high dispersion yield, the sonication process has to be optimized. Shirae et al. [1] reported that a repetitive sonication-centrifugation process can produce less-defective and longer SWCNT dispersion suitable for conductive film. For the M/S separation, however, we need individually dispersed SWCNTs, which require stronger sonication and ultracentrifugation process. In this study, therefore, we aimed to obtain highly-dispersed and less-defective SWCNTs using repetitive sonication-ultracentrifugation process.<br /><br />Pristine SWCNTs were sonicated in sodium cholate (SC) aqueous solution for relatively short time and then ultracentrifuged. Supernatant was collected as individually dispersed SWCNT solution. A sediment was dissolved in SC solution again and was used for the second cycle of the sonication and ultracentrifugation. The repetitive sonication-ultracentrifugation process was repeated until the total sonication time reaches 150 min. Fig. 1 shows G/D Raman intensity ratio of each supernatant and the sum of the collected SWCNT as supernatant for 20 and 30 min sonication case. Result for 150 min one-time sonication is also indicated. Clearly, 20 min sample shows higher G/D and higher yield than for 30 min and 150 min ones for any intermediate sonication time. This result strongly suggests that shorter sonication time is better for getting better quality SWCNTs with higher yield. Only one but serious problem is time and effort. We have to further optimize a cost-effective process towards high-performance device applications.

The VACNTs exhibit excellent dispersion stability in N-methyl pyrrolidone due to less entangling between CNTs. Significant promotion in specific capacities and low temperature performance have been achieved by adding highly-dispersed VACNTs into LiFePO4 cathodes.<br /><br />2) In order to solve the problem that CNTs are not able to be dispersed homogeneously in water due to the hydrophobicity of CNTs' side wall, S-doped carbon nanotubes (SCNTs) obtained by a post treatment approach are used as aqueous conductive additive for LiFePO<sub>4</sub> (LFP) cathodes in LIBs [2].

The device performance has been improved by making the fins finer, however, it is getting more and more difficult to make finer structure (&lt;1 mm) at large scale. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) also have high thermal conductivity and small mass density. In addition, simple fabrication of fine structure is possible via their self-organization process. Here we propose CNT-Al hybrid heat exchangers by growing micro-fins of CNTs directly on the conventional Al fins.<br /><br />CNT arrays can be grown directly on Al sheets by chemical vapor deposition (CVD), however, their height remained 0.1 mm or less due to the low melting point of Al (660 °C). We recently realized 1.1 mm-tall CNT arrays by CVD at 600 °C (Fig. 1a) [1]. To prevent the deactivation of Fe catalyst pre-sputtered on Al, the C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> source was fed at low concentration with CO<sub>2</sub> additive at high concentration. This method enabled tall CNT arrays but in a long CVD time (1.1 mm in 12 h). Then we elevated the C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> concentration and fed ferrocene (Fc) simultaneously, to grow CNTs fast and deposit Fe catalyst continuously. This method enabled &gt; 0.5 mm-tall CNT array in 2 h. Al sheet was prepatterned by using an pen-ink for selective catalyst deactivation, and the resulting CNT array was shrunk by wetting with ethanol and successive drying (Fig. 1b). Finally we examined the heat dissipation performance using plate heater and N<sub>2</sub> gas flow. Compared with the Al sheet, no change was observed with uniform CNT arrays and with shrunk CNT fins set perpendicular to the flow. Whereas the performance improved about twice with the CNT fin arrays set parallel to the flow (Fig. 1c). It is surprising to obtain such significant improvement despite of the incomplete fin structure. CNT roughness may induce vortex and make boundary layer thinner.

We report a versatile strategy to obtain stable gel with nanowires for 3D printing of electronic devices. Inorganic metallic and non-metallic nanowires, widely studied one-dimensional (1D) functional nanomaterials that are generally difficult to disperse in solvents for printing, can be effectively cross-linked, or hinged, by a small amount of graphene oxide nanosheets. The resulting 3D network forms a dynamically stable suspension in water, in a similar fashion as hydrogels in which 1D polymer chains are cross-linked via hydrogen bonding. Functional gels of silver nanowires, zinc oxide nanowires, and manganese oxide nanowires have all been prepared and printed into various 3D and self-supported architectures via extrusion-based 3D-printing. The electrical conductivity of the 3D-printed silver nanowire conductor can reach over 40,000 S/cm right after solidifying at ambient condition.

PSs correspond to tunneling of magnetic vortex across nanowires, resulting from thermal (tPS) or quantum (qPS) fluctuations. In this study, we fabricated superconducting nanowires by coating suspended carbon nanotubes with a thin NbN film. In the resistance-temperature characteristic curves, the residual resistance in the nanowire of 17 nm width and 1.8 µm length remains due to PSs well below the superconducting transition temperature. In addition, we observed the t-qPS crossover at 8 K which is the transition temperature of the electrode. This is because of the suppression of QPS caused by the anti-proximity effect (APE): the density of cooper-pairs in nanowires is varied by electrons from the normal conductive electrode. Moreover, in shorter nanowires of 350 nm length, we observed the resistance dip due to the strong APE. We believe that our results could be useful for next-generation quantum nanodevices.

Recently, defective nanocarbons without any doping have been employed as ORR catalysts with fantastic electrocatalytic activity, which is attributed to positive effects of edges and defects in nanocarbons, e.g. changing the local density of the π-electrons to increase the chemical reactivity [2, 3]. However, edges and defects as well as dopants have different influences on the deformations of electronic structures, and thereby distinct electrocatalytic activities. Thus, it is possible to design advanced ORR catalysts using nanocarbons as matrix to collect the diverse positive effects of edges, defects and dopants. Vertical graphene (VG), which is one of three-dimensional graphitic nanocarbons and stands perpendicularly on the substrate, consists of few-layer graphene sheets and has a large amount of open edges and various defects [4]. VG is regarded as an ideal candidate for ORR catalyst. In fact, defect-induced electrocatalysis in VG has been recently investigated and exhibited excellent ORR performances in our group. In this work, we will utilize nitrogen plasma to treat the VG film, which can be obtained from the decomposition of argon and methanol by plasma technique, and explore the synergistic effects of edges, defects and nitrogen-doping in VG on the ORR activities. The ORR performances including onset potential, current density, electron transfer number, selectivity, and stability will be investigated.

However, in transport measurement, there has been no other methods to access this issue other than by observing insulating behavior of resistance. In this work, we show that resistivity measurement of top and bottom gate voltage dependence can clearly exhibit splitting of energy band, at zero magnetic field by using tetra-layer graphene sample which was encapsulated by using hexagonal boron nitride and dual-gated. Mapping plot of zero-field resistance with respect to top and bottom gate voltage showed clear ridge structures due to resistance peaks (Fig. 1). It is seen that a single peak at zero perpendicular electric field (D<sub>⊥</sub> = 0) splits into two peaks and two ridges are formed by the vertical electric field. The peaks originate from bottoms of conduction and valence bands; the splitting of the resistance peak is due to formation of energy gap. This was verified by detailed measurements of magnetoresistance. Zeromode Landau levels appeared at the same carrier densities as those of the resistance peaks at zero-field. Similar peak splittings were observed for the heavy mass bilayer band in negative carrier densities. The presently observed features generally appear in graphene with more number of layers; we have observed similar peak structures in six-layer graphene but at different carrier densities.<br /><br />At the charge neutrality point of the same tetra-layer graphene sample, we also observed that the resistance grows with increasing the perpendicular electric field.

One successful method to produce CNT with high purity is to use ethanol as the carbon source and FeCo alloy as the catalyst[1]. When using ethanol as the carbon source, it is important which C-O bond or C-C bond dissociates during the process[2], which depends on catalysts used. In order to develop a better catalyst, it is required to know the mechanism of the dissociation process.<br /><br />In this study, the dissociation process of ethanol (CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OH) and carbon mono oxide (CO), which is generated by C-C bond dissociation of ethanol, is investigated by <i>ab</i> <i>initio</i> molecular dynamics simulation for three different catalysts Fe, Co and FeCo. It has been observed that the C-C bond dissociates on FeCo catalyst while it does not on Fe catalyst from the same fragment, CH<sub>3</sub>CO. The difference between two cases is found in the interaction between the oxygen atom of CH<sub>3</sub>CO and the metal atom in the catalyst. When the C-C bond dissociates, the oxygen atom is detached from the catalyst while the oxygen atom is kept on the catalyst when C-C bond does not dissociate (Fig.1). On the other hand, C-O bond of ethanol is more often dissociated on Fe catalyst. Moreover, C-O bond of carbon monoxide is also dissociated on Fe catalyst. From the result, it can be proposed that one advantage of alloy catalyst is that it is able to firstly dissociate C-C bond in ethanol and then dissociate C-O bond of generated carbon monoxide on Fe site.

This allows transfer of the conductive graphene patterns directly onto arbitrarily-shaped 3D objects with high resolution (Fig 1).

Decreasing the size of Pt catalysts is a valuable approach to significantly reduce the usage and cost of Pt catalysts without compromising catalytic activity. However, the smaller particles are less stable because of the higher surface free energy which enhances the rate of aggregation in small clusters. In this condition, a suitable support that strongly interacts with ultra-small structures of the metal catalyst should be employed to immobilize the metal atoms sufficiently and prevent the aggregation of small clusters or individual atoms (pseudo-atomic-scale catalysts). Finding such a catalyst support for immobilization of ultra-small structures of Pt has been challenging.<br /><br />In recent years, we have shown the great performance of carbon nanotubes as catalyst support for electrocatalysis [1-4]. In addition, we have found recently that single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) are promising supports to stabilize individual atoms or subnano clusters of Pt in order to produce much cheaper Pt electrocatalysts with almost a similar activity to that of bulk Pt for hydrogen production from electrochemical water splitting [5]. We developed a simple electroplating method to decorate pseudo-atomic scale Pt on the SWNTs without any pre-treatment on the tubes. We showed Pt atoms can be strongly immobilized on pristine small diameter SWNTs, suggesting SWNTs as promising candidates for the synthesis of single-atom catalysts. We observed that the activation rate of the graphite (GR) electrode with Pt is significantly slower than that of the SWNT. This can be attributed to the faster diffusion rate of Pt on GR than SWNT, which results in a higher agglomeration rate of Pt on GR. These results were in agreement with our density functional theory calculations which revealed individual Pt atoms can be strongly immobilized on the axial C-C sites of the SWNTs, for the fabrication of a highly active catalyst toward electrochemical H<sub>2</sub> production [5]. Furthermore, the diffusion rate of Pt atoms was calculated to be an order of magnitude slower on SWNT than graphene, attributing to the curved graphitic structure and chirality of SWNTs so that smaller diameter tubes stabilize the Pt atoms more efficiently.<br /><br />[1] M.

However, structural disintegration, limited access to redox sites and loss of electrical contact have long been identified as primary reasons for capacity loss and poor cyclic life of these materials. Thus, rational design can inhibit the side reaction by surface protection, make all redox sites accessible by increasing the intrinsic conductivity of the active materials, maintain a continues network for ionic and electronic flow and keep the structural integrity, resulting improved performance and excellent capacity retention with long cyclic life to meet the requirements set by United States Advanced Battery Consortium (USABC) for electrode materials in EVs. Here, upon combining active materials with conductive matrix, we have developed different hybrid nanostructures of metal oxides, hydroxides and metal alloys with N-doped graphene or carbon to control above mentioned problems and to achieve the goals set by USABC. The resulted nanostructured hybrid materials possess extraordinary performances as the electrodes of LIBs or LSBs with long cyclic stability and excellent rate capability. The high performance of the hybrid materials was resulted from the defined nannostructures and the synergistic effect of several components.

For the later, especially, long LCCs consisting of more than 6000 carbon atoms has been realized recently by high-temperature annealing of double-walled CNTs. Unlike the short chains as insulator, the LLCCs are semiconductors since their band gaps were determined between 1.8 and 2.3 eV [3], shining a light on the future research on such LLCCs. Generally, the yield of the LCCs is still low because of the limited residual carbon inside the nanotubes as the carbon source of the LCC formation. Inspired by this, here we show that extra carbon sources introduced from different solvents allows to enhance the yield of both short and long LCCs. Several types of carbon-containing solvents, have been filled inside single-walled CNTs. These solvents can be decomposed at high-temperature and transformed into small inner CNTs, and then LCCs were formed inside those inner tubes.

Because of its low set-up cost and high production yield, scalability, and degree of control, floating catalyst chemical vapor deposition (FCCVD) is now widely used among several techniques of CNT synthesis available. Specifically, macroscale CNT architectures, e.g., films and fibers, can be directly fabricated based on FCCVD. Herein, high-performance CNT films are produced in two ways based on FCCVD. One is CNT aerosol from CO-FeCp2 FCCVD directly deposited into CNT films on filters in room temperature [1]. The effect of CO2 as promoter on yield, morphology, and chirality distribution of SWCNTs is systematically studied. In addition, the high-performance transparent conductive films (TCFs) of CNTs (Fig.1a) are fabricated a simple dry transfer method. With appropriate amount of CO2, CNT TCFs exhibit improved performance up to 86.8 Ω/sq. at 90 % transmittance with AuCl3 doping. The excellent performance of CNT films is attributed to the enrichment of metallic SWCNTs and optimized geometry, e.g., long, straight and small bundles. Another is CNT aerosol transformed into CNT aerogel for tubular film fabrication in FCCVD. Based on the hydrocarbon-FeCp2 FCCVD, the tubular CNT films can be directly and continuously produced (Fig.1b). The optimized synthesis process manifests a high carbon efficiency (~ 60%), high extrusion yield (hundreds of meters per hour), and stable controllability in the fabrication of freestanding films with excellent transparent and conductive performance. Moreover, the continuous CNT fibers can be directly fabricated by shrinking tubular CNT films with liquid (Fig.1c) [2].

We find that the SOC splitting can be enhanced by 10 times by rotation.<br /><br />Whereas a wide variety of potential applications have been proposed for graphene using its unusual physical properties, the lack of SOC limits its utilization for spintronics. To overcome this drawback, various strategies to enhance the SOC have been developed [2]. Using the proximity effect is one of the promising methods. Experimentally, monolayer graphene can be efficiently grown on the surface of TMDC, and there the strong SOC of TMDC induces a spin splitting on graphene. This approach is further supported by the first principles studies [4-6] of graphene stacked on various TMDCs, where the SOC splitting increases from the intrinsic value of order meV to 0.5 - 20 meV. However, since the first principles method only works for the commensurate systems, all the previous studies are limited to the non-rotated geometries where the lattice orientations of graphene and TMDC are aligned.

Despite of the efforts in the past two decades, a complete understanding to catalytic synthesis of SWNTs is still lacking, precluding a ration synthesis of SWNTs with enriched species.<br /><br />In this contribution, we will first address the evolution of catalysts during CVD process, where phase separation between different components are observed with the assistance of environmental transmission electron microscopy [1, 2]. Although alloy formation is lacking in both FeTi and FePt catalysts, the respective presence of Ti and Pt affects the catalytic behaviors of active Fe component, favoring the synthesis of large-chiral-angle SWNTs when applying CO as the carbon source [1, 2].<br /><br />Subsequently, the roles of the carbon source in determining SWNT growth mode are clarified. Compared with CH<sub>4</sub>, CO facilitates the nucleation of SWNTs with perpendicular mode, resulting in the synthesis of SWNTs with small diameters [3], which provides a strategy for chiral-selective of small-diameter SWNTs, like (6, 5) species. A number of catalysts, such as Fe-MgO, FeMn-MgO [4], Co-MgO [5] and Ni-MgO [6], is applied for preferentially growing (6, 5) nanotube using CO as the carbon source. During growth process, unreduced metal cations have strong binding energy with the reduced metal counterparts, constraining the aggregation of metal particles. Remarkably, the Co-MgO catalyst affords the synthesis of small diameter (6, 5) SWNT even at a temperature as high as 800 <sup>o</sup>C, which could be correlated with the unique SWNT tip-growth mode [5]. Furthermore, by alternating carbon sources from CO to CH<sub>4</sub> during CVD process, SWNT intramolecular junctions are fabricated [7]. The creation of SWNT junctions is attributed to the different growth modes adopted by SWNT when using different carbon sources (Fig .1).","poster_num":"PC037"},{"id":"910722","category":"T","title":"Ab Initio Study of Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate (SDS) and Related Surfactants on Single-Wall Carbon Nanotubes","affl":"Fujitsu Labs.","author":["Mari, Ohfuchi"],"corr_name":"Mari, Ohfuchi","corr_email":"mari.ohfuti@jp.fujitsu.com","content":"One-dimensional materials have potential to exhibit extremely high thermoelectric performance [1].

Previously, we have investigated the thermoelectric properties of SWCNTs as a function of Fermi-level using an electrolyte gating technique [2]. However, the observed relationships between the Fermi level and the Seebeck coefficients of semiconducting SWCNTs were not in agreement with theoretical predictions. It is suggested that even a small amount of impurities (~1%) affects the thermoelectric properties [3]. Recently, we established a separating technique, which controls pH of solutions using CO2 bubbling in gel-column chromatography, to obtain extremely high-purity single-chirality SWCNTs (6,5) with purity of more than 99% (Fig.1) [4].

Gel chromatography experiments [1], which brought about metal/semiconductor separation of SWCNTs, proposed a separation mechanism, where metallic (M-)SWCNTs having higher-density surfactant SDS on the surface pass through the gel, whereas semiconducting (S-)SWCNTs with lower-density SDS adsorb onto the gel. In recent times the subject of separation has been extended not only to the electronic type but to the chirality of SWCNTs. Aqueous two-phase extraction (ATPE) [2] separates SWCNTs by their electronic type, diameter, or chirality. The amount of SDS on SWCNTs also plays an important role in controlling their hydrophobicity in combination with other surfactants and salt. In spite of such progress in separation experiments, the fundamental origin causing the difference between M- and S-SWCNTs in the adsorption of SDS surfactants was not clear. Recently we showed that the adsorption energy of sodium dodecyl (DS) ions for M-SWCNTs is much stronger than those for S-SWCNTs, which is considered to be attributable to the difference in the band energy of M- and S-SWCNTs, using ab initio methods [3]. As shown in Fig. 1, dodecyl sulfate (DS) ions are more likely to adsorb onto SWCNTs than sodium (Na) ions or SDS molecules. Whereas the adsorption energy of SDS molecules becomes stronger as the diameter of the SWCNTs increases, the adsorption energy of DS ions for metallic (5, 5) nanotubes is much stronger than those for semiconducting (6, 5) or (10, 3) nanotubes. This causes a larger aggregation number of DS ions on M-SWCNTs, and also a separation of SWCNTs by the electronic type. This result is also consistent with the results of the multi-column gel chromatography where (10, 3) CNTs are obtained after (5, 6) CNTs.<br /><br />In this study we perform density functional theory (DFT) calculations on the adsorption of several surfactants related to SDS onto SWCNTs and investigate the effect of the tail length and the head part of surfactants.

Recently, many researchers focused on improving the density of SWCNTs by both direct growth and post-treatment methods. Direct growth method could obtain SWCNT samples with high quality, but the density could not face the requirement. Basically, the most critical issue to affect the density in direct growth process is the poisoning phenomenon of catalysts. Recently, researchers tried to solve this problem by catalyst designing or processing multiple-cycle growth.<br /><br />In this work, we designed multiple catalysts reactivation process by introducing H<sub>2</sub> treatment to improve the array density of SWCNTs. During the experiment, we found that the efficiency of catalyst reactivation decreased with the increase of the cycle times. Based on this phenomenon, we proposed two possible types of catalyst poisoning: Physical Poisoning (PP) and Structural Poisoning (SP). Catalysts with PP are covered by carbon and prevented from contacting with the carbon feedback, while catalysts with SP transform to other stable structures without activation. Thus, only poisoned catalysts with PP type could be reactivated during H<sub>2</sub> treatment process, for H<sub>2</sub> could act as etchants to remove the surface carbon on catalysts. With this method, we obtained the SWCNT arrays with the density of 18 tubes/μm. Furthermore, we studied the relationship between the PP ratio and the carbon solubility in different catalyst. It was found that PP ratio increased with the decreasing carbon solubility, which showed better performance in catalyst reactivation process.","poster_num":"PC088"},{"id":"910908","category":"S1","title":"Synthesis of highly crystalline multilayer graphene on graphene template by high growth temperature","affl":"Osaka University","author":["Ryota, Negishi","Masato, Maruoka","Yui, Ogawa","Makoto, Takamura","Yoshitaka, Taniyasu","Yoshihiro, Kobayashi"],"corr_name":"Ryota, Negishi","corr_email":"negishi@ap.eng.osaka-u.ac.jp","content":"Heat conduction properties of individual low-dimensional materials is of fundamental interest for understanding nanoscale physics and developing applications like thermal management and thermoelectric energy conversion, but the existing methods for nanoscale thermal measurements are very limited [1],[2].

K' valley states experience an increase of the tunnel coupling at low field, followed by subsequent decoupling. In contrast, K valley states decouple from the leads monotonically. We show that this phenomenon stems from the unique combination of cylindrical topology and bipartite atomic lattice. Longitudinal and transversal momentum are coupled, allowing manipulation of the longitudinal electronic wave function via the Aharonov-Bohm phase. At zero field, the nanotube acts similar to a &quot;quarter wavelength resonator&quot;, where a wave function amplitude is finite near one of the contacts. A large magnetic field restores quantum box behaviour comparable to a &quot;half wavelength resonator&quot;, where the amplitude vanishes on both sides.

Recent achievement in growing large graphene films [1] which are not only monocrystals but also display selective crystallographic orientation, resembles in an important way the chiral-selective CNT growth [2]. We will focus on the different fundamental factors in play of essentially &quot;pure&quot; crystalline nanomaterial synthesis. First, we will discuss the theoretical origins and quantitative kinetics underlying the success with monocrystalline graphene films [1, 3], obtained by CVD without substrate epitaxy but instead by guiding the distribution of feedstock or imposing other condition-gradients, Fig. 1. Deeper exploration of the &quot;evolutionary selection&quot; concept and how it operates in 2D will be discussed. The grains forming a polycrystalline front compete to survive and only the ones that have the fastest propagation vector aligned with the growth direction eventually dominate, becoming the monocrystalline growth front. It is particularly important for possible extension to other, non-graphene, materials of lower symmeries [4]. In contrast to graphene grains, fusing and competing, the well-isolated individual CNTs lack the basic means for similar &quot;evolutionary selection&quot;: each one is on its own. Yet recent observations do show high selectivity towards the (12,6) CNTs when a solid Co7W6 catalyst is used [2]. Second then, we discuss how these experiments can be understood within the framework of our theory of CNT helicity [5], customized for the specific catalyst facets. Based on large-scale DFT calculations, we provide first-principles evidence that the CNT edge in contact with Co-W catalysts, as well as Ni and Co, can undergo an armchair-zigzag &quot;phase segregation&quot; [6], leading to an asymmetric edge, which largely suppresses the pronounced chiral-angle dependence of the interface energy typical for the conventional, circular CNT edge. Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations reveal that such segregation substantially alters the carbon insertion kinetics and the edge growth mode, and allow us to identify conditions resulting in overall preference for (12,6) tubes.<br /><br />[1] I.

However, it is unclear that whether exciton energy transfer occurs in the photoluminescence of structure-sorted semiconducting SWCNT solution, in which most of nanotubes are usually considered to be highly suspended. This is very important for quantitatively evaluating the abundance and the content rate of specific (<i>n</i>, <i>m</i>) species.<br /><br />In this work, we investigated the exciton energy transfer between different (<i>n</i>, <i>m</i>) SWCNTs using (<i>n</i>, <i>m</i>)-sorted samples by gel chromatography method [3-5]. To reduce the tube-tube distance and thus induce the exciton energy transfer, we added an equal amount of solution with high SWCNT concentration of (9, 4) SWCNTs (E<sub>11</sub> absorbance is about 2 for optical path length of 10 mm) into the target (6, 5) solutions with the same but low SWCNT concentration (E<sub>11</sub> absorbance is about 0.1). After measuring the photoluminescence of each mixed solution, we found that the photoluminescence intensity derived from (6, 5) SWCNTs for the mixed solutions significantly decreased compared with the (6, 5) reference solution with the same concentration. This decrease could be explained by the exciton energy transfer of (6, 5) SWCNTs in solution. Importantly, we replaced (9, 4) solution by (10, 3) solution with the same E<sub>11</sub> absorbance, and then observed a more significant decease for (6, 5) photoluminescence intensity. One of the possible explanations is that the excitons are easier to transfer from (6, 5) to (10, 3) SWCNTs because the difference in the band gap between (6, 5) to (10, 3) is larger.

The size of each CNT detector was 5mm in length and 1mm in width. We here used this scanner to remotely sense the existence of water drop by irradiating 90-GHz oscillator beam. As depicted in Fig. 1 (a), the water drop was put on an aluminum plate. The metal almost perfectly reflects the THz wave whereas the water absorbs the THz wave well. This means that our THz scanner can work as a sensitive probe for water detection by mapping out the intensity profile of the reflected THz wave. Figure 2 (b) clearly displays that the obtained THz image successfully revealed the existence of the water. This result thus provides an interesting possibility of non-contact and non-destructive determination and analysis of water contents in various materials, bio-samples, and industrial products.<br /><br />This work was supported in part by the JST-Mirai Program from the Japan Science and Technology Agency.","poster_num":"PS047"},{"id":"911961","category":"C2","title":"Ultrafast time-resolved electron diffraction: nanoscopic phenomena occurring in bulk-scaled carbon nanotubes during annealing","affl":"Okayama University","author":["Masaki, Hada","Hirotaka, Inoue","Takayuki, Yoshiyama","Daiki, Chujo","Taihei, Kuroda","Taiga, Morimoto","Naoshi, Ikeda","Takayoshi, Yokoya","Tomoharu, Tokunaga","Toshio, Seki","Jiro, Matsuo","Kazuhiro, Fujimori","Chihiro, Itoh","Takeshi, Nishikawa","Yoshifumi, Yamashita","Shin-ya, Koshihara","Toshihiko, Kiwa","Yasuhiko, Hayashi"],"corr_name":"Masaki, Hada","corr_email":"hadamasaki@okayama-u.ac.jp","content":"Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are anticipated to be the successor of silicon in next generation integrated circuits. However, one great challenge to the practical application of this concept is the need to grow horizontal semiconducting CNT arrays with very high purity. Here we show that this roadblock can be eliminated by switching the direction of an applied electric field during synthesis. This electro-renucleation approach twists the chirality of the CNTs to produce nearly-defect-free s-CNTs horizontally-aligned on the substrate with less than 0.1% residual metallic CNT. In principle, this residual percentage can be further reduced to less than 1 ppm simply by tuning the CNTs' diameters to around 1.3 nm. Electro-renucleation thus offers a potential pathway to practical applications of CNT electronics and opens up a new avenue for large-scale selective synthesis of semiconducting CNTs and other nanomaterials.","poster_num":"PC090"},{"id":"911982","category":"T","title":"Enhanced Laser Field by Planar and Curved Graphitic Materials Applied for Water Decomposition: A TDDFT Study","affl":"National Institude of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST)","author":["Yoshiyuki, Miyamoto","Hong, Zhang","Xinlu, Zhang","Angel, Rubio"],"corr_name":"Yoshiyuki, Miyamoto","corr_email":"yoshi-miyamoto@aist.go.jp","content":"Ultralight bulk-scaled materials with excellent electrical, thermal, and mechanical properties are on demand for broad applications in automobiles, aircrafts and outer-space developments. CNTs is one of the desirable materials, which exhibits extremely high tensile strength, electric and thermal conductivities. However, these physical properties are valid only within the single CNT or on the nanometer-scale, and they decrease by several orders of magnitude when the CNTs are assembled as bulk-scaled devices. CNTs are bound up via van der Waals force in the CNT assemblies, and the amorphous carbon and impurities in the interface among the CNTs bottleneck the mechanical strength as well as hamper the electric and thermal conductions. Annealing of CNT assembly under noble gas atmosphere is prospective to control the interface among the CNTs. The electric and thermal conductions are improved through annealing process at extremely high temperature. However, this process often induces surface damage and graphitization of the CNTs, resulting in impairing the flexibility of CNT assemblies.

By assuming the full-width-of-half-maximum 10fs for wavelength 800 nm, we have studied decomposition of a water molecule being isolated or being located near 2-dimensional sheets or carbon nanotubes. The computed power threshold for water decomposition can be reduced by factor 2 by using the 2-dimensional sheet, and by factor 4 by using the carbon nanotubes compared to the power for decomposing pure water. By computing the modulated optical field by TDDFT calculation, field enhancement near 2D sheet [1] as well as near carbon nanotube [2] was observed that is consistent with factor of threshold power reduction for water decomposition. The cause of reduction is optical field enhancement near 2 dimensional sheet as well as carbon nanotube. Especially for carbon nanotube, the field enhancement is not only coming from polarization but also by curvature of the wall of the tube that helps field concentration [2].

In digital ICs, high performance p- and n-channel thin-film transistors (TFTs) are utilized to construct complementary (or referred to as CMOS) circuits with ultra-lower power consumption and high noise margin. SWCNT- TFTs fabricated using ordinary processes show highly stable p-type characteristics under standard ambient conditions. However, air-stable and high-performance n-channel SWCNT-TFTs requires additional treatment. Recently, several approaches have been employed to fabricate n-channel SWCNT-TFTs, mainly through chemical doping of the CNT-channel, passivating the CNT-channel with a high-k dielectric or using low work-function metal contacts. N-channel SWCNT-TFTs suffer from poor stability and high process complexity, thereby hindering optimal operation of integrated SWCNT CMOS circuits. Wide-bandgap oxide semiconductors are a family of very promising electronic materials for both passive and active device applications. Until now, most of reported high performance metal oxide thin film transistors (TFTs) show n-type characteristics. Although a number of papers have been published for p-type metal oxide TFTs, the performances of p-type metal oxide TFTs are not able to match those of n-type metal oxide TFTs in order to fulfil the requirements of complementary circuits. Another approach is to integrate high performance p-type carbon nanotube (CNT)-TFTs with n-channel metal oxide-TFTs to achieve the functionality of a complementary circuit. In this presentation, we report on an optoelectrical hybrid inverter, in which a p-type CNT-TFT and an n-type indium-tin-oxide (ITO) TFT are involved. Without light illumination, the device functions as an ordinary inverter. Interestingly, as the conductance of the ultrathin ITO channel in the ITO-TFT is increased by several orders of magnitude under UV light illumination, the logic output does respond to the UV light modulation and the input electrical signal. If UV light illumination and input electrical signal are taken as two logic inputs, the device works as a very good NOR gate. At present, the device is built on a fused quartz substrate and it is of high transmittance of ~90%. The device can, in principle, be implemented on a flexible and transparent substrate for flexible and transparent logic circuits.","poster_num":"PO037"},{"id":"912185","category":"C1","title":"High-harmonic generation of THz light in single-wall carbon nanotubes","affl":"Tokyo Metropolitan University","author":["Hiroyuki, Nishidome","Kohei, Nagai","Yota, Ichinose","Kengo, Fukuhara","Junji, Nozaki","Junko, Eda","Yohei, Yogida","Koichiro, Tanaka","Kazuhiro, Yanagi"],"corr_name":"Kazuhiro, Yanagi","corr_email":"yanagi-kazuhiro@tmu.ac.jp","content":"Industrial separation of single-chirality species (<i>n,</i> <i>m</i>) with identical properties is critical for their application in the fields of electronics, optoelectronic, and bio-imaging etc. In the past several years, gel chromatography method was developed to achieve the high-resolution structure separation of small-diameter (0.8-1.2 nm) [1-3] and large-diameter (1.2-1.6nm) SWCNTs [4].

In this case, CCVD synthesis is a multivariable process with the ability to control parameters such as catalytic metals (Fe, Co, Ni) and their combinations, carbon sources (CH<sub>4</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> or C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>), temperature of synthesis.<br /><br />The incorporation of a heteroatom in CNT structure significantly affects their electronic structure. It is well known that doping of CNTs with various elements such as nitrogen, boron or potassium allows changing both electronic and chemical properties of nanotubes. Replacing carbon with a nitrogen atom leads to an improvement in the conductivity of nanotubes. The mainly number of works is devoted to the synthesis and study of nitrogen-doped multi-walled CNTs (N-MWNTs) due to the simplicity of synthesis and scale production of MWNTs. Works devoted to the synthesis of nitrogen-doped single-walled CNTs (N-SWNTs) are significantly less. Finally, the works related to the synthesis of nitrogen-doped double-walled CNTs (N-DWNTs) are even less because of the complexity of N-DWNTs synthesis. DWNTs combine the best properties of MWNTs and SWNTs such as excellent mechanical, chemical and electrical characteristics. In this case, DWNTs are particularly interesting for modifying the outer layer with the internal state unchanged.<br /><br />In the present work, CCVD synthesis of N-DWNTs was carried out in a horizontal quartz tube reactor with a length of 2 m and a diameter of 10 cm with a constant temperature zone of about 15 cm. Catalyst MgO<sub>0.99</sub>(Co<sub>1-x</sub>Mo<sub>x</sub>)<sub>0.01</sub>O was synthesized by explosion method. The reaction mixture of gases CH<sub>4</sub> and H<sub>2</sub> was bubbling through CH<sub>3</sub>CN and fed to CVD reactor. N-DWNTs with different nitrogen contents were obtained depending on the temperature and time of synthesis. The obtained N-DWNTs were characterized by transmission electron microscopy. The type and amount of incorporated nitrogen were determined using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. N-DWNTs have demonstrated promising results as an electrode material in supercapacitors.<br /><br />This work was supported by the Russian Foundation of Basic Research (grant 16-53-150003) and PRC CNRS/RFBR (Grant No 1023).","poster_num":"PC050"},{"id":"912675","category":"C1","title":"Experimental and computational study of interlayer interaction effects on the high-frequency Raman features of double-walled carbon nanotubes","affl":"Laboratoire Charles Coulomb, University of Montpellier, Montpellier, ","author":["Dmitry, Levshov","Valentin, Popov","Thierry, Michel","Huy-Nam, Tran","Jean-Louis, Sauvajol","Raul, Arenal","Ahmed, Zahab","Matthieu, Paillet"],"corr_name":"Dmitry, Levshov","corr_email":"dmitry.levshov@gmail.com","content":"Single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) films have a great potential to replace indium tin oxide films for applications in transparent and conductive electronics.

These mathematical expressions are &quot;user defined&quot; meaning that they are derived from theory or purely empirical. Parameters for the mathematical expressions are then fitted so that the FFs agrees with the results from higher accuracy calculations such as density functional theory (DFT) or experimental data. Having a fixed set of mathematical expressions is clearly a limitation, since there is no certainty that the chosen expressions correctly model the underlying quantum mechanics for a system of interest. Therefore, the next logical step is to get rid of having fixed mathematical expressions and allow for the description of interatomic potentials to be derived automatically. This can be done using machine learning to create neural network force fields (NNFFs) that can describe interatomic potentials with DFT levels of accuracy. Until now, most published NNFFs have been developed for bulk systems such as metals and oxides [1]. Here we investigate the possibility of creating NNFFs for carbon nanomaterials using the Atomistic Machine-learning Package [2] (AMP) with training data generated from DFT calculations. The ultimate goal is to develop NNFFs capable of performing atomistic simulations of carbon nanomaterials with DFT levels of accuracy in energies and forces, but with speeds similar to today's empirical force fields. This would allow researchers to model carbon nanomaterial processes (such as growth) at timescales and accuracies that are currently not possible.","poster_num":"PS050"},{"id":"912765","category":"C1","title":"Thermoelectric Properties of Aligned Single-Wall Carbon Nanotube Films","affl":"Tokyo Metropolitan University","author":["Kengo, Fukuhara","Yota, Ichinose","Yohei, Yomogida","Weilu, Gao","Junichiro, Kono","Kazuhiro, Yanagi"],"corr_name":"Kazuhiro, Yanagi","corr_email":"yanagi-kazuhiro@tmu.ac.jp","content":"Recently we demonstrated synthesis of confined one-dimensional linear carbon chains (LCCs) inside double-walled carbon nanotubes with the shortest chains consisting of around 30 carbon atoms (polyyne) and the longest chains with a record length of more than 6000 carbon atoms (carbyne) [1].

We have developed a high-performance RO nanocomposite membrane<sup>1</sup> using multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) and fully aromatic polyamide (PA), hereafter abbreviated as MWCNT-PA.

We present the flexibility and stability of hydrogen terminated phosphorene nanoflakes with diameters ranging from the molecular size (0.2-0.6 nm) to nano-size (1-2 nm) using quantum chemical computations, ab-initio molecular dynamics as well as using the External Force is Explicitly Included (EFEI) method.<br /><br />Our computations [4] showed that while the flexibility of hydrogen terminated phosphorene nanoflakes depends on their geometry, they keep their quasi-planar structure up to at least 500K, while at more elevated temperatures they distort and decompose. Hydrogen terminated phosphorene nanoflakes are energetically more stable than the white phosphorus, however the investigation of the gas phase free energies showed the opposite trend. In the gas phase the temperature and the pressure have great effects on the stability of phosphorene nanoflakes. Our computations showed that during gas phase synthesis from phosphine the formation of white phosphorus is preferred over the due to the change of the entropy. This highlights the importance of the precursor for the gas phase synthesis. Larger phosphorene nanoflakes may also be synthesized in the gas phase from phosphine.

However, SWNTs are much softer in their radial compared to their axial direction, which results in a reversible elastic deformation of the cross section when applying sufficiently strong hydrostatic pressures. This article provides further evidence, via time dependent Raman spectroscopy, that a stable deformed state exists as a result of van-der-Waals-interactions within individual tubes and specifically that these tubes can fully recover from this deformed state on surprisingly long time scales on the order of tens of minutes. In order to distinguish inter-tube from intra-tube effects, all experiments have been performed with densely packed, vertically aligned, free-standing SWNT arrays in comparison to individual, debundled SWNTs.

Among the mainstream challenges, the polysulfide (PS) shuttle effect, insulating nature of sulfur, volume expansion of sulfur, and self-discharge are very crucial factors, which need to be resolved urgently to improve the electrochemical performance of LSBs.

Applying an electrical bias across droplets of NaCl placed at both ends of the nanotubes causes the formation of bright and dark lines along the nanotubes in scanning electron microscopy. Kelvin probe force microscopy and mass spectrometry imaging of individual nanotubes suggest that such a phenomenon corresponds to the transport of a cation-enriched solution along the nanotubes, while the anion-enriched solution counter-migrates along the adjacent substrate. Blocking the exterior of the nanotubes prevents both the bright/dark lines and flow of current through the nanotubes, confirming the absence of interior ion transport and electron current. The cation-preferring transport results in the formation of positively charged salt crystals along the nanotubes (with a cation-to-anion ratio&gt;1.5 for KCl) followed by the subsequent migration of crystals in the direction of cation flux. Molecular dynamics simulation shows that cation-π interaction is responsible for such cation-preference observed during transport.

Recently, the gel chromatography technique has been developed for the separation of the synthetic SWCNT mixture. With this technique, we achieved the separation of metallic and semiconducting SWCNTs, and even the production of single-chirality SWCNTs with identical properties [1-2].

Without new treatments, WHO predicted that the number of new cancer patients could increase to twenty-seven million a year by 2030. Researches have shown that metastasis, chemotherapeutic resistance and recurrence are the major hurdles to successful treatment of cancer which may be mediated by a subpopulation of tumor cells, cancer stem cells, displaying stem cell properties and giving rise to metastases. Nanomedicines hold great promise in biomedical applications especially in cancer therapeutics. Currently, nanomaterials have been used as carriers of conventional drugs, oligonucleotides or bioactive molecules where the nanomaterials may improve their bioavailability. In this talk, we will summarize the progress of polyhydroxylated Gd@C<sub>82</sub>(OH)<sub>22</sub> on the molecular mechanism for antineoplastic properties.<br /><br />Since 2004, we found that polyhydroxylated Gd@C<sub>82</sub>(OH)<sub>22</sub> possessed exciting antineoplastic properties. One of the most fascinating features is its strikingly low cyto- and systemic-toxicity in the normal mouse despite its remarkable anti-tumor capacity in a variety of solid cancers. With a size of approximately one nanometer, Gd@C<sub>82</sub>(OH)<sub>22</sub> nanoparticles can be formed via hydrogen bond interaction in solution with sizes ranging from 20 to 120 nm, depending on the concentrations and microenvironmental pHs. The size variation with pH alterations can be understood by the deprotonation of the hydroxyl groups on the cage surface. The flexible feature of microenvironment-dependent size makes their efficient uptake by hypoxic cells under hypoxic conditions.<br /><br />Gd@C<sub>82</sub>(OH)<sub>22</sub> nanoparticle blocks epithelial mesenchymal transition with resultant efficient elimination of breast cancer stem cells. This leads to a striking abrogation of tumor initiation and metastasis in mouse models. Gd@C<sub>82</sub>(OH)<sub>22</sub> mediates these effects by blocking TGF-β signaling under normoxia and as a bi-potent inhibitor of HIF-1α and TGF-β under hypoxia. We also found that Gd@C<sub>82</sub>(OH)<sub>22</sub> contribute to cancer immunotherapy by regulating macrophages. The activated macrophages inhibit the growth of several cancer cell types, which is dependent on an NF-κB-mediated release of multiple cytokines. It is noteworthy that we developed a karyon-like hybrid nanoparticle using fullerenol, which significantly reduced the chemodrug side effects by utilizing the radical scavenging ability of fullerenol. This novel combination strategy with chemodrugs together with low toxicity of these nanomaterials in normal tissue holds a promise on their clinical therapeutic potential.","poster_num":"PS054"},{"id":"913666","category":"S3","title":"Femtosecond Laser Maskless Patterning of Carbon Nanomaterials","affl":"National Research University of Electronic Technology","author":["Aleksei, Emelianov","Ivan, Bobrinetskiy","Nerea, Otero","Pablo, Romero"],"corr_name":"Aleksei, Emelianov","corr_email":"emmsowton@gmail.com","content":"Permeation through nanometre-pore materials has been attracting unwavering interest due to fundamental differences in governing mechanisms at macroscopic and molecular scales, the importance of water permeation in living systems, and relevance for filtration and separation techniques.

Taking into account that any potential application requires nanotubes with specific characteristics, influence of catalyst nature and growth conditions on MWCNT quality becomes a key factor to be solved. However, MWCNTs are class of materials with wide range of properties. This restrains the development of fine theoretical models for MWCNT structure. E.g. Raman spectroscopy theory - one of the most common and suitable express methods to study nanotube structure - mostly deals with more convenient nanocarbons: graphene and single-walled carbon nanotubes. Thus, only phenomenological experimental approach can be applied nowadays to examine MWCNTs. Most of the corresponding models consider the ratio of intensities of G and D bands of MWCNT Raman spectra as a metric for defective structure. However, as it was already shown for graphene and single-walled carbon nanotubes, the of G/D ratio as a function of defect concentration has extremum, providing certain ambiguity without additional studies. Moreover, the G band is strongly affected by &quot;saturation&quot; of carbon defects with hydrogen.<br /><br />Here we present the systematic study of the ratio of 2D and D bands of MWCNT Raman spectra. The influence of the catalyst particle size and chemical nature (Fe, Co, Mo, Mn, and their combinations), reaction temperature, posttreatment (defect annealing, ball milling) have been studied from the 2D/D point of view.

For laser excitation energies 2.33 and 2.41 eV, close to optical absorption of the oligomer, we observed a quick attenuation of the RBM modes of the host SWCNTs from the composite 4T@SWCNTs, explained here through of pressure-induced charge transfer between nanotube and 4T molecule. This assumption is supported by the slow attenuation of the RBM modes intensity of empty SWCNTs, which are expected to have no charge transfer. Besides, a discontinuity in ɷ<sub>4T</sub> vs. pressure plot around 0.8 GPa for modes lying in 650-1300 cm<sup>-1</sup>, concomitant with the disappearance of the lowest RBM frequency from the host SWCNTs, were attributed as being another indicative of pressure-induced charge transfer. Furthermore, a fast detuning of the G-band of the host SWCNTs emphasizes the strong charge transfer. Aiming to probe how the charge transfer evolves with pressure for energy excitation far from 4T resonance, we performed a high pressure experiment using a laser excitation energy of 1.96 eV. Our results revealed a much slower decreasing of the G-band intensity, evidencing a less pronounced pressure-induced charge transferred from the 4T molecules to SWCNT. Finally, in order to verify the influence of the 4T ordering into SWCNTs, we carried out more three high pressure experiment using the 2.41 eV energy excitation varying the host tube diameters (0.8, 1.4 and 1.7 nm). The results showed an optimized pressure-induced charge transfer for the SWCNT diameter of 1.4 nm, where two 4T molecules are encaged closer two to tube walls along the tube axis [2].

At present, growth of these materials suffers from issues of quality such as polycrystallinity in the case of graphene, and inseparable mixtures of differently chiral nanotubes. Synthesis of these materials in their &quot;pure&quot; crystalline phases, which means monocrystalline graphene, and chiral-selective CNTs, has been a longtime goal in the research community. Recent achievements in the growth of large single-crystal graphene films [1] by evolutionary selection mechanism parallels with the experimentally observed high chiral-selectivity of (12,6) nanotubes on solid catalyst [2], since both lead to selectivity of a specific crystalline phase among several other similar phases. In this poster, we explain these parallels and their fundamental aspects. First, we explore the concept of &quot;evolutionary selection growth&quot; in the context of 2D materials and how it is the underlying mechanism in the success of growing large monocrystalline graphene by local control of feedstock distribution and no substrate epitaxy [1,3]. Briefly, it describes the evolution of a polycrystalline front as a competition between neighboring grains, where the fastest one eventually dominates becoming the monocrystalline growth front. In the case of low-symmetry materials, its significance is more prominent [4]. Next, we explain the experimental observations of high (12,6) selectivity for solid Co7W6 catalysts within the framework of our theory of CNT helicity [5], customized for the specific catalyst facets. We demonstrate using large-scale DFT calculations, that a CNT edge in contact with a solid metal catalyst can undergo an armchair-zigzag &quot;phase segregation&quot;, thereby forming an asymmetric edge, and suppresses the dependence of the tube interface energy on its chiral angle, as is typically known for the &quot;conventional&quot; CNT edge. Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations were used to study the carbon insertion kinetics, which allowed us to identify conditions that show preference for selectivity of (12,6) tubes.<br /><br />[1] I.

In this study, the bulk CNT/7055Al composites were fabricated. 1.5wt.% of CNT was firstly dispersed uniformly in 7055Al powder by high energy ball milling, and the mixed powder was condensed using vacuum hot pressing. The composite billets were hot extruded at 370°C and 420°C and followed by solution and artificial aging treatment (T6). Tensile tests were conducted, microstructures were examined by optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The tensile strength of the composite extruded at 370 °C was 830MPa, and the elongation was 1.05%, while the tensile strength and elongation of the composite extruded at 420°C were decreased to 807MPa and 0.24%. Microstructures examination indicated that some coarse grains were formed in the ultrafine grains matrix due to liquid phase formation during sintering, and some large precipitates segregated along the boundaries between coarse and fine grains were observed in the billet. After extruded at 370 °C, there still existed many residual precipitates at the boundaries between the coarse and fine grains, while in the composite extruded at 420 °C, the segregation of precipitates almost disappeared. After T6 treatment, the large precipitates in the composites extruded at both temperatures disappeared, and precipitate free zones (PFZ) were observed at the boundaries between the coarse and fine grains in the composite extruded at 420°C, while PFZ were absent in the composite extruded at 370°C.

The subwavelength structure of the conductor strongly decreases the mean free path of the electrons, leading to an extra hot electron absorption besides considering the Joule's heating. Thus we designed an experiment to study the photoelectric effect of the ultra-black carbon aerogels. The visible light could induce strong light current, while the infrared could not. The light current is in direct proportion to the intensity of the lights but saturated when the light power is higher than ~80 mW. The saturated current has been demonstrated to be induced by the producing of plasmas.

Recently, hBN has also become a strategic material in the fabrication of van der Waals heterostructures. Stacked with graphene and/or transition metal dichalcogenides, it can reveal the best of their physical properties [3,4]. As a key material for 2D heterostructures, it is therefore crucial to better understand hBN intrinsic properties and to capitalize them for developping relevant characterization spectroscopic techniques.<br /><br />This talk will review recent advances made thanks to the development of appropriate spectroscopies to the UV range - cathodoluminescence (CL) at 4K, [5,6] angular resolved low loss EELS [7] and Raman spectroscopy [8] - combined with ab initio simulations and tight binding modeling [9,10]. We shall address in particular the long-time debate on the excitonic origin of hBN luminescence, following our previous studies on the impact of defects [6] and layer confinement on the luminescence properties [11]. The efficiency of excitonic radiative recombinations is compared for different hBN sources, ranking them in terms of crystallinity and purity [12]. Thanks to the spectral calibration of the set-up, we performed a quantitative analysis of the excitonic luminescence efficiency in a reference hBN crystal and evidenced a remarkable high value, almost two orders of magnitude higher than for diamond, although both materials present indirect bandgaps [13]. Contrary to diamond and ZnO, the hBN luminescence efficiency remains stable up to room temperature, consistently with tightly bound excitons. Ab initio calculations of the exciton dispersion in bulk hBN confirm that the luminescence is related to an indirect exciton, with a theoretical binding energy equal to 300 meV in agreement with the observed thermal stability of luminescence and standing 100 meV below the direct exciton [13].<br /><br />The benefits of these findings will be shown to solve the long-standing debate on the Stoke shift in bulk hBN [13] and will be discussed for accounting low dimensionality effects observed in few atomic layers [11].

It can be seen that photocurrent density measured with MnO<sub>x</sub>/g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> (2.5 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> at 1.25 V<sub>Ag/AgCl</sub>) electrode is higher than that of pure g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> (0.007 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> at 1.25 V<sub>Ag/AgCl</sub>). The EIS analyses were performed to analyze the phenomenon. The MnO<sub>x</sub>/g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> electrode showed the fastest interfacial electron transfer which is in accordance with its enhanced photoelectroactivity. For this, given its high conductivity, MnO<sub>x</sub> was introduced into g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> to captured photogenerated holes and reduced photogenerated electrons-hole recombination.

Carbon nanotube (CNT) thin films are promising electronic materials for transistors and integrated circuits [1-3], biosensors [4,5], and other passive components to build flexible and stretchable devices with excellent wearability and performance. Recently, high-yield and reproducible fabrication of CNT TFTs have become possible by using purified semiconducting CNTs, leading extensive study on circuit applications. An integration of analog circuits with a sensor is essential for wearable sensor devices to amplify the sensing signal as preventing external noise. A differential amplifier is a fundamental analog amplification circuit used for various sensor devices. In this work, we are focusing on the analog circuit application of CNT TFTs. To design CNT-based analog circuits, circuit simulation tools have been developed with a precise device model which has been built on the basis of electrical characterizations of CNT TFTs. We have realized differential amplifiers on a flexible and transparent plastic film.<br /><br />Device modelling is indispensable for circuit design. We built the RC-ladder device model based on the charge based model for CNT TFTs, where a correction of pinch off condition was taken into account, considering the contact resistances between CNTs. In order to fit the subthreshold current, the charge equation in weak inversion characteristics was modified. The proposed model well expresses the output characteristics. The frequency dependence of capacitance-voltage characteristic was also built by considering the non-quasi-static effect in the Mayer model. CNT-based analog or analog/digital mixed circuits such as differential amplifiers and analog/digital converters were designed by using the circuit simulation with proposed device model.<br /><br />We also realized the differential amplifiers on a flexible plastic film.

In this work, we investigated the electrostatic properties of graphene under an external electric field, using density functional theory with effective screening medium method. To investigate how the field emission properties depend on the detailed edge shape and termination, we consider the graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) with the edge angles of 0º(armchair), 8º, 16º, 24º, or 30º(zigzag) and with functionalized edges by functional group R (H, O, NH, COH, COOH, or OH).

The armchair edge possesses lower potential barrier and larger field emission current than edges with other shapes. Furthermore, hydrogenation decreases the potential barrier by introducing a dipole, causing an increase in the field emission current. In addition, for chiral GNRs, the electron emission is primarily attributed to the zigzag portion of edges because of the concentration of electrons arising from either the dangling bond state or the edge state [1]. On the other hand, the potential barrier for electron emission and field emission current are sensitive to the functional group attached GNR edge. The termination of O increases the potential barrier, causing the decrease in the emission current, while other functional groups decrease the potential barrier, causing the increase in the emission current. Interestingly, all cases show the decrease in the potential barrier with increase in the electric field, except the case of OH. The anomalous phenomenon for the case of OH is caused by the electrons in the nearly free electron state in the vacuum [2].","poster_num":"PO069"},{"id":"922922","category":"T","title":"Energetics and electronic structure of graphene adsorbing COx under an external electric field","affl":"University of Tsukuba","author":["Manaho, Matsubara","Susumu, Okada"],"corr_name":"Manaho, Matsubara","corr_email":"mmatsubara@comas.frsc.tsukuba.ac.jp","content":"Recently two-dimensional in-plane heterogeneous structure of graphene and h-BN with bulk grain boundaries has been experimentally synthesized, because of their small lattice mismatch.

This is the allowed thermal budget for microelectronic and device manufacturing technologies. Using ultra-thin films of purely metallic Fe or Co along with process decoupling (catalyst formation/activation from nanotube nucleation/growth), we demonstrate it is possible to grow forests at temperatures as low as 375 °C. Of equal importance, the tubes appear to grow with very good alignment and well-graphitized walls. To accomplish this, it is essential to fully reduce the catalyst in ammonia (for proper activation) and finely control the amount of carbon source supplied, as low temperatures tend to easily lead to catalyst deactivation. On this basis, we propose a manufacturing process technology capable of producing nanotube forests employing microelectronic-compatible conditions, so it would allow direct nanotube integration into devices. The key requirement is to deposit the metal catalyst and proceed to restructuring into nanoparticles (and further nanotube growth) without exposition to air, hence avoiding metal oxidization. The typically high temperatures reported in the literature (600-800 °C) are largely related to the need of reducing the catalyst to purely metallic state. On the other hand, at temperatures as low as 375 °C, catalyst surface diffusion is, too, virtually negligible, and, as a result, the tubes grow with much more homogenous diameters and a narrow distribution of chiral angles, averaging seven to nine different chiralities per sample. Although the number of chiral angles is steadily observed to be below ten, further improvement appears to be extremely challenging to achieve. The essential level of narrowness in catalyst size and size-distribution requires nanoparticle control are at the very atomic level.

Although PSCs are proven to be promising next-generation solar devices, further breakthroughs in terms of efficiency and stability are necessary to supersede conventional silicon solar cells. With regard to the performance and stability of PSCs, perovskite grain boundaries play a significant role. Structural disorders at these boundaries induce shallow trap states and non-radiative recombination of localised charge carriers which serve as limitations to PSC performance. At the same time, these areas are also responsible for the perovskite degradation, as the reaction with moisture in air has been found to initiate from the grain boundaries. Therefore, technologies aiming at passivating the perovskite grains are highly desired.<br /><br />Over the last two decades, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with an exceptional charge carrier property with outstanding chemical and mechanical stability have generated a lot of excitement among researchers for their device applicability. Especially, single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) with a certain chirality possess a wide range of direct bandgap of up to 2 eV, qualifying for a light-harvesting medium with strong absorption and high carrier mobility. Semiconducting SWNTs (s-SWNTs) are highly conductive along the tube axis and therefore can function effectively as a charge-transporter between perovskite grains. While there have been a few reports on phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) as a charge-transporter at the grain boundaries of perovskite films, fullerenes have inherently low carrier mobility and low stability compared to SWNTs.

For flexible electronics applicatoins, devices are fabricated on the plastic substrate, which easily expands or shrinks in size during the fabrication process. Then, a large alignment margin is necessary in the lithography process. This results in the degradation of operation speed of the circuits due to the large orverlap capacitances between the source/drain and the gate electrodes. Self-align process is a key process to eliminate the overlap capacitances. In this study, we have realized a simple self-align prcess with backside exposure for CNT TFTs by utilizing the transparency of the plastic substrate. We have also demonstrated a drastic reduction of the parasitic capacitance and hence switching time of ICs.<br /><br />Figure 1 shows the schematic structure of the self-aligned CNT TFT fabricated on the transparent and flexible substrate. The device has a bottom gate structure. The source and drain electrodes were self-aligned to the gate electrode by exposing from the backside of the substrate in the lithography process.

However, these heterogeneous reactions exhibit sluggish kinetics due to multi-step electron transfer and only occur at triple-phase boundary regions. Up to now, tremendous attention has been attracted to develop cost-effective and high-performance electrocatalysts to boost the electrocatalytic activities as promising alternatives to noble metal counterparts. In addition to the prolific achievements in materials science, the advances in interface chemistry are also very critical in consideration of the complex phenomena proceeded at triple-phase boundary regions, such as mass diffusion, electron transfer, and surface reaction. Therefore, insightful principles and effective strategies for a comprehensive optimization, ranging from active sites to electrochemical interface, are necessary to fully enhance the electrocatalytic performance aiming at practical device applications.<br /><br />In this talk, we overview our recent attempts toward efficient gas-involving electrocatalysis with multiscale principles from the respect of electronic structure, hierarchical morphology, and electrode interface on 2D electrocatalysts step by step. It is widely accepted that the intrinsic activity of individual active sites is directly influenced by their electronic structure. Heteroatom doping and topological defects are demonstrated to be the most effective strategies for metal-free nanocarbon materials, while the cationic (e.g., Ni, Fe, Co, Sn) and anionic (e.g., O, S, OH) regulation is revealed to be a promising method for transition metal compounds, to alter the electronic structure and generate high activity. Additionally, the apparent activity of the whole electrocatalyst is significantly impacted by its hierarchical morphology. The active sites of nanocarbon materials are expected to be enriched on the surface for a full exposure and utilization; the hybridization of other active components with nanocarbon materials should achieve a uniform dispersion in nanoscale and a strongly coupled interface, thereby ensuring the electron transfer and boosting the activity. Furthermore, steady and favorable electrochemical interfaces are strongly anticipated in working electrodes for optimal reaction conditions. The powdery electrocatalysts are suggested to be constructed into self-supported electrodes for more efficient and stable catalysis integrally, while the local microenvironment can be versatilely modified by ionic liquids with more beneficial gas solubility and hydrophobicity.<br /><br />Collectively, with the all-round regulation of the electronic structure, hierarchical morphology, and electrode interface, the electrocatalytic performances are demonstrated to be comprehensively facilitated. Such multiscale principles stemmed from the in-depth insights on the structure-activity relationship and heterogeneous reaction characteristics will no doubt pave the way for the future development of gas-involving energy electrocatalysis, and also afford constructive inspirations in a broad range of research including CO<sub>2</sub> reduction reaction, hydrogen peroxide production, nitrogen reduction reaction, and other important electrocatalytic activation of small molecules.<br /><br />References<br /><br />1.

Despite great effort devoted to solving the polysulfide shuttle between the cathode and anode electrodes, it remains as a serious challenge to build high-stable lithium sulfur battery, which related to the diffusion and reaction between polysulfides and the metal lithium anode.<br /><br />We proposed a strategy of introducing an ion selective membrane to improve the stability and coulombic efficiency of lithium sulfur battery. Generally, porous polymer membrane serves as membranes in batteries to avoid the short circuit between anode and cathode electrodes, which cannot stop the shuttle effect. By the introduction of permselective functional layer, the polysulfide anions can be confined in the cathode side, which would favor the cyclic stability and lower self-discharge performance.<br /><br />We replace the routine membrane with an ion selective membrane, in which the sulfonate-ended perfluoroalkyl ether groups on the ionic separators are connected by pores or channels that are around several nanometers in sizes. These -SO3-- groups coated channels allow ion hopping of positive charge species (Li+) but reject hopping of negative ions, such as polysulfide anions (Sn2-) in this specific case due to the coulombic interactions. Consequently, this cation permselective membrane acts as an electrostatic shield for polysulfide anions, and confines the polysulfides in the cathode side. An ultra-low decay rate of 0.08% per cycle is achieved within the initial 500 cycles for membrane developed in this work, which is less than half that of the routine membranes.<br /><br />We also proposed a unique lithium-sulfur battery configuration with ultrathin graphene oxide (GO) membrane for high stability. The oxygen electronegative atoms modified GO into a polar plane and the carboxyl groups acted as ion hopping sites of positively charged species (Li+) while rejected the transportation of negatively charged species (Sn2-) due to the electrostatic interactions. Such electrostatic repulsion and physical inhibition largely decreased the transference of polysulfides across the GO membrane in lithium-sulfur system. By the incorporation of permselective GO membrane, cyclic capacity decay rate is also reduced from 0.49 to 0.23 %/cycle.<br /><br />Such ion selective membrane is versatile for various electrodes and working conditions, which is promising for the construction of high performance batteries.<br /><br />[1] J.Q.

Recent years have witnessed great progress in controlled growth of large graphene single crystals; however, the issue of surface roughness is far from being addressed. Here, the corrugation at the interface of copper (Cu) and graphene, including Cu step bunches (CuSB) and graphene wrinkles, were investigated and ascribed to the anisotropic strain relaxation. We found that the corrugation strongly relied on Cu crystallographic orientations, specifically, the packed density and anisotropic atomic configuration. Dense Cu step bunches were prone to form on loose packed faces due to the instability of surface dynamics. On an anisotropic Cu crystal surface, Cu step bunches and graphene wrinkles formed in two perpendicular directions to release the anisotropic interfacial stress, as revealed by morphology imaging and vibrational analysis. Cu(111) is the suitable crystal face for growth of ultraflat graphene with roughness as low as 0.20 nm. We believe the findings would contribute to clarifying the interplay between graphene and Cu crystal faces, and reducing surface roughness of graphene by engineering the crystallographic orientation of Cu substrates.

The mechanical and physical properties of CNT fibers reported so far are comparable to these of existing high performance fibers, such as carbon fibers, glass fibers, aramid fibers, and some other polymeric fibers. However, CNT fibers exhibit far lower mechanical and physical properties than individual CNTs, which is mainly due to the weak interfacial load transfer between adjacent nanotubes. To enhance the interactions of CNTs in the fiber, in this study, 2D graphene oxide (GO) sheets, which possess similar atomistic structures and properties with CNTs, were introduced into the CNT fibers to establish more connections between CNTs. The hybrid fiber was further heated to reduce the GO and enhance the CNT/graphene interaction. The effects of the GO size, GO concentration, as well as the annealing temperature on the fiber performance were investigated. It has been found that the tensile strength of the hybrid fibers can be 100% higher than that of the pure CNT fibers. Atomistic simulations were also implemented to reveal the underlying mechanism of such enhancement.

Though these imperfect emerging technologies are not ready for general purpose computing, there are applications like approximate computing, which can tolerate few errors and can be suitable for these technologies even suffering from immature and imperfect process.<br /><br />Since its introduction in 1991, CNT is extensively studied and is seemingly closest in comparison to other LDMs in terms of high volume manufacturing. The CNFET fabrication process consisting of separation and placement of solution based CNTs has become quite popular, because of the consistent reporting of excellent semiconducting purity (&gt; 99.9% of semiconducting CNTs after separation step). Thus with the current fabrication process, the problem of unwanted shorts caused by presence of metallic CNTs (&lt;0.01%) seems to be under control. However, after the placement of solution based CNTs onto the substrate, there are missing CNTs (also referred as open CNTs) in trenches connecting source and drain of CNFET. The open CNTs can lead to open circuits (CNFET without single semiconducting CNT) or reduction in driving current. The percentage of open CNTs (<i>PCNT<sub>open</sub></i>) in recent reports, have been reported to be &gt; 30% for narrow trench widths, and is expected to increase with further scaling of trench widths. A high percentage of open CNTs would cause reduced drive currents, thus inducing failure in (1) meeting the minimum frequency requirement (due to increase in critical path delay), (2) meeting the minimum Static Noise Margin (SNM) requirement. Thus, the presence of open CNTs should be considered for the fair evaluation of the performance of CNFET circuits.<br /><br />In recent years, there is significant growth of interest in approximate computing targeted towards applications like image, video processing where few errors during computation does not affect the quality of results to great extent. These applications thus relax the requirement to realize exact functionality; thus the circuits can be made much simpler with lesser nodes, reduced stages, and reduced capacitances at few nodes; thus enabling lesser critical path delay and lesser chances of violation of SNM requirement. For the mature technologies like silicon, the approximate circuits are obtained with the objective of reducing the energy consumption and area with minimal logic error; however, for emerging technologies including CNFETs the approximate circuits are obtained with the primary objective of reduced process induced degradation.<br /><br />In this work, we first present a methodology to evaluate process induced degradation in CNFET based circuits due to imperfect process; followed by methodology to generate approximate circuits in order to reduce the process induced degradation. With an example of 16-bit CNFET adder; we have shown that approximate circuits have great potential in reducing the process-induced degradation with minimal logic error; along with additional benefits of reduced energy-delay product and area. This work shows the applicability of CNFET based circuits (even with current imperfect fabrication process) for error resilient applications.","poster_num":"PA052"},{"id":"953459","category":"A2","title":"Hollow Metal Oxide Nanoparticles Encapsulated into B, N Co-Doped Graphitic Nanotubes as High-Performance Lithium-Ion Battery Anodes","affl":"Peking University","author":["Hassina, Tabassum","Ruqiang, Zou","Asif, Mahmood"],"corr_name":"Ruqiang, Zou","corr_email":"rzoupku@163.com","content":"This research article describes three-dimensional flow of carbon nanotubes due to bidirectional nonlinearly stretched surface.

Indeed, graphenes hold enormous promise as materials for energy technologies. GNRs are regarded as a new generation of semiconductors superior to i) silicon in view of the required miniaturization of printed circuits and superior to ii) classical conjugated polymers due to better band structure control. Above all, graphene as a two-dimensional polymer and GNRs are true challenges for materials synthesis.<br /><br />In our &quot;bottom-up&quot; synthesis of GNRs, repetitive cycloaddition in solution is shown to afford branched polyphenylene polymers which serve as precursors for perfectly &quot;graphitized&quot;, solution-processable GNRs as long as 600 nm. An alternative on-surface synthesis utilizes immobilization of suitable monomers and in-situ STM-control of the polymerization to secure structural perfection. A further option is to employ chemical vapor deposition by introducing oligophenylene monomers as initial building blocks. Only these three methods of controlled synthesis ensure sufficient structural precision over, for example, the nature of the edges. Our approach is thus superior to methods of lithiography or unzipping carbon nanotubes.<br /><br />It is a synthetic breakthrough which leads to new materials science and physics. We fabricate field effect transistors from, both, single GNRs and GNR networks and compare the performance with that of conjugated polymers. Of particular importance is the synthesis of GNRs with zig-zag edges because they provide edge localized states. The associated spins reveal long correlation times. These characteristics provide entries to spintronics and even quantum computing. Nature 2010, 466, 470; Nature Chem. 2011, 3, 61; Nature Chem. 2012, 4, 699; Adv. Polym. Sci. 2013, 262, 61; Angew.

Aptamers are oligonucleotides (DNAs or RNAs) that specifically bind to a large range of molecular targets with and high affinity, including small molecules, metal ions, proteins and even the whole cells. The high affinity and specificity, low cost and reliability of the aptamer makes it a great candidate for biomolecular recognition.<br /><br />The cocaine aptamer was first created by Stojanovic<sup>[1]</sup> for developing an anti-cocaine aptamer sensor. Since then, many works have focused on developing cocaine aptamer sensors with lower detection limit and higher selectivity based on fluorescent<sup>[2]</sup>, electrochemical<sup>[3]</sup> and FET<sup>[4]</sup> signals. However, these methods lack the exploration of intrinsic properties of cocaine aptamer, and the functional moieties and the exact conformational changes are blurry during the process of binding and therefore limit the amelioration of the structure of cocaine aptamer and the improvement of the performance of cocaine aptamer sensors. Uptill now, only a few works have studied the conformational changes of cocaine aptamers by NMR<sup>[5]</sup>, 2D PELDOR<sup>[6]</sup>, CD spectroscopy<sup>[7]</sup> et al. Whereas, these techniques could not do real-time detection and the results were the ensemble average of a great many of molecules which would conceal the details of a single molecule conformational changes.<br /><br />Since our group has a great platform for single-molecule dynamic detection, we combined the aptamer conformational changes with ultra-high sensitivity of electrical signals. We designed a partially complementary double stranded DNA with cocaine aptamer sequence in one strand and immobilized it with graphene electrode by amide linkage. The conformational changes of the aptamer would lead to the varieties of currents. By means of the analysis of current data, we could further decide which kind of conformational changes happens before and after cocaine binding, which would provide robust and precise evidence for real time conformational knowledge of cocaine aptamer.","poster_num":"PA053"},{"id":"967522","category":"U","title":"Batch production of 6-inch uniform monolayer MoS2 catalyzed by sodium in glass","affl":"Peking University","author":["Pengfei, Yang"],"corr_name":"Pengfei, Yang","corr_email":"yangpf-cnc@pku.edu.cn","content":"Biological magnetic sensing, the ability of animals to calibrate motion navigation according to the Earth's magnetic field, has been widely accepted as a fact but rather controversial for the underlying mechanisms, which were previously proposed to be based on magnetite or chemical magnetoreception.

One is that such kind of magnetic proteins was expected to promote the deep understanding of magnetic sensing. The other, furthermore, is that magnetic features of the protein might accommodate useful tools to magnetically manipulate bio-molecules with the contribution of magnetogenetics. Although meaningful, the verification of several critical issues related to the biocompass-protein progresses slowly for the limitation of traditional methods in biological investigation, which can be exemplified by the exploration of the mechanism of light-magnet coupling, transferring of magnetic signals within neuro, essence of Magnetoreception and so on. Carbon material-based electrical bio-sensors have been developed dramatically, owing to the characteristics of label-free, real-time detection, high sensitivity and good selectivity. The ability of detecting tiny potential changes in the environment and being modified easily enables graphene Field Effect Transistor (G-FET) to identify the biological interactions such as protein-protein, aptamer-protein, DNA-DNA, biotin-streptavidin, etc. For example, the single-molecule lysozyme dynamics has been monitored by Single Wall Nano-Tube electronic circuit.

The compressive strain in the epitaxial regions (0.25-0.40%) is higher than regions where the graphene is not epitaxial with the underlying surface (0.20-0.25%), with the formation of wrinkles in the non-epitaxial regions. (A very small fraction of the islands have 2 regions-one is epitaxial, the other non-epitaxial-roughly 1 in every 100,000 islands.) DFT calculations suggest a large frictional force between the epitaxial graphene and the Cu(111) substrate that provides an energy barrier to the formation of wrinkles in the graphene. Enhanced chemical reactivity is found in epitaxial graphene on Cu(111) foils as compared to non-epitaxial graphene on polycrystalline Cu foils for certain chemical reactions.<br /><br />An adlayer-free single layer graphene film is always obtained on Cu(111) foil for a relatively wide synthesis window of H<sub>2</sub>/CH<sub>4</sub> ratios and CVD pressures.

We have observed intersubband plasmons (ISBPs) in gated and aligned SWCNT films [3]. For parallel polarization, interband exciton absorption peaks disappeared as carriers were injected, whereas, for perpendicular polarization, a new peak due to an ISBP appeared and grew as the carrier density increased. We have also made the first direct observation of a cross-polarized exciton peak in optical absorption spectra for an aligned undoped (6,5) film [4], which allowed us to quantitatively estimate the oscillator strength of this transition and the effective dielectric constant of this film. We further built an exciton-polariton architecture by incorporating an aligned (6,5) film inside a Fabry-Pérot microcavity. This system displayed a continuous transition from the ultrastrong-coupling regime to the weak-coupling regime through facile polarization control [5]. The obtained dispersion surfaces revealed the existence of two equienergy arcs in momentum space that are bounded by exceptional points. Furthermore, the vacuum Rabi splitting exhibited cooperative enhancement when the number of excitons was increased by increasing the SWCNT film thickness. Finally, we have recently demonstrated that aligned SWCNTs work as hyperbolic thermal emitters that are stable at temperatures greater than 100 K [6].

A novel composite fiber is prepared by employing 2D reduced graphene oxides (rGOs) and 1D carbon nanotubes (CNTs). The composite fiber possesses much better electrochemical and mechanical properties simultaneously due to the inside brick-bridge network, in which rGOs serve as the brick and CNTs as the bridge. As a result, a large specific capacity of 522 mAh g<sup>-1</sup> is obtained for the rGO/CNT fiber, which is 3.2 times that of the rGO fiber. Meantime, tensile strength of the rGO/CNT fiber is 1.6 times that of the rGO fiber. The work reveals superiority of composites composed of diverse-dimensional carbon allotropes, which may be applied in energy storage.","poster_num":"PA092"},{"id":"1026200","category":"S1","title":"Highly conductive nanocomposite enabled by an accordion-like graphene network","affl":"Donghua University","author":["Lijun, Yang","Wei, Weng","Haiyan, Huang","Wei, Liu","Ouli, Fu","Meifang, Zhu"],"corr_name":"Lijun, Yang","corr_email":"yanglijun211322@163.com","content":"Nowadays, flexible electronics is a hotspot worldwide. As an indispensable component, flexible energy storage devices (FESDs) serving as the power system have witnessed a tremendous advance over the decade. Among a variety of formats, FESDs in fiber or textile shape characterized with high flexibility and wearability are deemed as a promising family. As for the materials, graphene has been actively studied in FESDs since its advent in 2004. And after 2011, when the graphene fiber was worked out for the first time, much effort has been devoted to the application of the graphene fibers in FESDs. However, because the graphene nanosheets are prone to stacking, the electrochemical properties of the primary graphene fibers are poor or mediocre. To this end, various structures have been engineered together with diverse fillers.<br /><br />Here, some typical graphene composite fibers proposed by our lab are introduced. Firstly, graphene composite fibers with high-energy active fillers, e.g., MnO<sub>2</sub> and activated carbon, were presented. Secondly, graphene composite fibers with non-active fillers, e.g., PVA polymer and Ag nanowire, were illustrated. Their electrochemical performance was enhanced by improving the properties of wettability and conductivity. Thirdly, graphene composite fibers with designed structures were addressed, e.g., alignment and porosity.","poster_num":"PS006"}]
